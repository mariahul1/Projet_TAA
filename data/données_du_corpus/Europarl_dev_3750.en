the settlers have opened fire .
how can we describe these new massacres and this Palestinian rebellion .
more stone-throwing youths ?
it is more than that .
the Palestinian security forces are also firing .
Ariel Sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd .
while condemning all forms of violence , we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence .
on the one hand , there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and , on the other , there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation .
this is not the work of Hamas : it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision-makers .
it is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel .
we must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations : the fighting must cease , the Israeli soldiers must be withdrawn , there must be an international inquiry , at which Europe must be present , and the Palestinian people must be protected .
it would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions , starting with resolutions 338 , 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes , apply .
this would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel &apos;s - by now - firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity .
the right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us , as are the Israelis themselves who , together with the Palestinians , are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence .
but the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important .
in my opinion , Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction , and it must be clear and resolute .
it is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but rights have to be respected , and here rights are not being respected .
it is not a question of the Israelis making concessions ; we must enforce the law .
Madam President , the bloody confrontations which have taken place in the last few days in Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip , the West Bank and Israel are particularly serious , because of the high numbers of victims and also because they have brought renewed talk of exclusion as regards the State of Israel , talk that we thought belonged to the past and which is dangerously irresponsible .
the violence , the unacceptable provocation , the disproportionate reaction against the Palestinian people must not become a pretext for questioning the fundamental right of both peoples , Israeli and Palestinian , to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood .
some of the statements that have been made - here , even , and elsewhere - are disturbing .
they are not likely to make negotiations any easier , quite the contrary .
the events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is .
so we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible .
the only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talks and Mr Solana , who has just left us , is right to concentrate his efforts in that direction .
and here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States , France and Egypt in particular .
the main lesson to be drawn from these grave troubles , the source of which has been Jerusalem , and more specifically the Temple Mount and the Al Aqsa Mosque compound , is that as long as the negotiations on Jerusalem and in particular on the Holy places are put off , peace cannot be definitely assured .
it is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy places .
so , negotiations should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive areas neutral , and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian legislative Council , Mr Ahmed Qurie ?
I think this avenue ought to be explored as soon as possible , because until the Jerusalem question is resolved , it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontations likely to degenerate in the same way as the tragic events we are currently witnessing .
Madam President , there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian legislative Council .
Madam President , I have just been talking to the group Chairman in the front row .
I have not yet had a chance to talk to the others further up , but we are entirely in favour of your making a statement expressing what I believe is the unanimous feeling of this Parliament towards the Serb people .
that is the most direct method and we hope the message can reach those people in their heroic struggle for democracy .
thank you for that proposal , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , and for your confidence in me .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have one minute to put my position on an issue which has been close to my heart since 1967 . the evidence seems to be that the State of Israel has no intention , and never has had any intention , of negotiating seriously with Palestine and granting it all the powers of a sovereign and independent nation .
the State of Israel sees many advantages in this situation of latent conflict and does not hesitate to make use of them .
whatever the alleged good intentions of certain Israeli leaders , nothing has really changed for the Palestinians .
Colonisation of the occupied territories is increasing .
the economic dependence of Palestine is increasing .
access to the Muslim Holy places is being made more and more difficult .
the Palestinian leaders are in a no-win situation .
the fact is , they either accept perpetual talks , generally under the auspices of the United States , and endorse the expansionist policy of the State of Israel or , with the aid of other Muslim countries and their traditional friends , they create a new and more favourable balance of power .
this new balance of power calls , in particular , for the immediate proclamation of a Palestinian State , the use of oil as a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence .
Madam President , the peace process in the Middle East is extremely fragile .
such a situation requires tact .
Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon , must be refrained from .
however , violence is not a legitimate response to provocation , and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not .
if the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process , it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action .
to this end , my group has tabled two amendments to the resolution to that effect .
it is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations .
it is heartrending if children are sacrificed in a battle which should be settled around the negotiating table .
the position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations .
I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line : pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace .
Madam President , over the last few days , we have watched the dream of peace in the Middle East disintegrate .
the horrifying pictures of children running for cover being killed and of civilians being fired at from tanks and helicopters give us just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides , Israel and Palestine , if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible .
that is the most important aspect at the moment , not apportioning blame and condemnation .
the European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it .
however , I am not prepared - as I have been urged on several occasions , purely in order to appear fair - to refrain from calling the events of the last few days by their proper name or from making the same demands on both sides , as if the provocation and force were divided equally between them .
or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there ?
should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw its tanks and helicopters from Israeli towns and villages and stop firing on civilian Israelis ?
should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli children cowering behind walls and trying to take cover behind barrels ?
I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness .
but I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity , as Mrs Albright said , in order to gloss things over , purely to appear fair towards both sides .
in this respect , I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk .
Madam President , I think the text of this resolution is a perfect demonstration that Europe will never act as a mediator between Israel and Palestine .
once again , there is confusion between , on the one hand , a democratic State doing its best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and , on the other , the institution at the heart of Palestine which , under provocation certainly , immediately takes up arms to shoot at the Israeli forces of order .
that is happening again today , and that is what will prevent , and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years , leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone .
finally , regarding Serbia , I would like to tell Mr Bar√≥n Crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject , given that throughout the previous parliament his group was willing to go to any lengths to block any action designed to bring Milosevic to justice , and when a majority was achieved it was not with the support of the Socialist Group .
Madam President , fellow Members . it is of course difficult , as events unfold in Belgrade , to sit here calmly and give a speech which was prepared before all this came to pass .
I expected today &apos; s events to take place last Monday .
we all know that the people have stormed Parliament , that the television station , which has been fully occupied by the army , has been stormed and that army vehicles and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade .
we can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people , not a dictator such as Milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators .
since democracy raised its head again in Serbia last Monday , the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility .
the results of the elections on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible .
I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it : the democratic opposition and , most importantly , the people and the leader of the democratic organisation , Mr Kostunica .
I think that , in him , we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concerns and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe .
since 24 September , Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler .
everyone , including his own citizens in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator , who is using all the brutal , ugly and contemptuous instruments of dictatorship in his own country .
special police units , dirty tricks and deception , quasi-legal procedures which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him .
he has managed for years , with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media , to deceive the people in his own country and , unfortunately , many in the western world , to whom he has misrepresented the real situation .
at last , all that is at an end .
the people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic has no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime .
which is why we must support Serbia in its bid for freedom .
those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for years now and who are familiar with the situation in the region , know how difficult the fight against authoritarian rulers and tyrants in most of these countries was and , in places , still is .
sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our views and our way of thinking , which do not fit in with their traditions and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset .
I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contacts in Serbia , who may well not understand us immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us , partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural differences which I have mentioned .
I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulties in communicating with the newly elected president as a sign of irreconcilable differences between us and the advocates of democracy in Serbia .
there are no such differences .
we can help them on the path to Europe .
if we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start packages through at long last , then we must do more than just talk .
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions , because these sanctions have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer .
please help us to give the people a glimmer of hope , with Kostunica , so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia .
( applause )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . we are delighted to hear that the people of Yugoslavia , mainly in Belgrade but also in other towns , have known how to take their fate into their own hands and have done so .
however , our delight is tainted with fear that there may be bloodshed , that not everyone wants to and can accept the voice , power and strength of the people .
everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed , because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a veritable disaster .
Mr Dupuis , you have abused this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy .
I have only one thing to say to you : my group and I are unequivocally in favour of bringing Milosevic to justice before the court in the Hague .
that has always been our objective ; but we have a still higher objective , which is to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed is avoided .
the Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along .
we shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives , because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them .
secondly , we are in a very delicate position and , therefore , we too trust that there will be fast changes in Yugoslavia and Serbia , because the situation is not easy in either Montenegro or Kosovo .
here , too , I have one thing to say : we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro , but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states .
Kosovo must be independent come what may and Montenegro must be independent come what may , just to ensure that Serbia is weakened .
Madam President , despite his twisting and squirming we are probably seeing Milosevic &apos;s final moments in power .
it is a power that he has abused cynically and he is now trying to cheat democracy .
we are certain that Mr Milosevic will fall , possibly this evening , certainly soon .
what we are seeing on CNN is more than the fall of Milosevic .
it is the end of the dreary succession of 20th century European tyrants .
Serbia is suffering the final pangs of fascism on the fringes of our own Union .
we will all rejoice when that suffering is over .
as the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament , as a symbol of united free Europe , to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is slightly bizarre that we should be discussing Serbia in this Chamber at a time when the Serbian parliament building is going up in flames and hundreds of thousands of people are on the streets .
despite this , I would like to make an attempt at explaining why I am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment .
there is of course the support of hundreds of thousands of people - the figure of one million has even been mooted - who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help Mr Kostunica against the wishes of Mr Milosevic .
there are also the latest reports on the role of the police , which , as has been apparent for some time , have been in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime , and which , as it appears from the first reports now coming in , have opted to side with the demonstrators ; according to the latest reports , the same could happen with the army .
there is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation has resigned , this being a signal , I believe , that he refuses to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the Milosevic regime any longer .
I would like to make two minor observations with regard to the future .
I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by Doris Pack to reach the decision quickly , in fact as quickly as possible , to lift the sanctions , because these have done far more harm than good .
finally , I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity , and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed , so that we , in tandem with this new government , can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia .
Madam President , I am wondering how we can help democratic Yugoslavia , considering the way in which events appear to be , or we hope they are , unfolding now .
our group has confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make .
however , Madam President and Commissioner , we need more than pretty words .
do not say in general terms , &quot; Serbia belongs in Europe &quot; , which is , after all , something which you have only recently discovered .
we refer to Yugoslavia but it is no help to Mr Kostunica if we appear to be implying that Montenegro , for example , will secede .
and to ensure we do go beyond pretty words , do you intend to propose as quickly as possible that Yugoslavia , by that I mean democratic Yugoslavia , be included in the list of candidate countries for the enlargement of the European Union ?
we at least hope that you do .
Madam President , Slobodan Milosevic &apos; s latest polling box fraud comes as no surprise to us . it is an electoral manoeuvre which is ad nauseam reminiscent of an extremely poor political reputation .
precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst - and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago .
is the Yugoslav President really making way for his opponent and probably lawfully elected successor , Vojislav Kostunica , without any bloodshed ?
a pressing question indeed .
along with the Serbian population , the Western world would be only too happy with such a switch in power in Belgrade .
however , a sense of relief should not be attended by reckless carelessness .
the European Union and the United States are being warned about this from various quarters in the region .
they consider Kostunica - in terms of ideas - just as much a Great-Serbian nationalist as Milosevic , with all that entails for the Montenegrins and Kosovars .
in summary , should Kostunica take Milosevic &apos; s place , the West would do well to make aid strictly dependent on his concrete efforts to establish a constitutional state in Serbia and Yugoslavia .
Madam President , I hesitated before asking to speak again because I noticed that your press secretaries just handed you something and I thought perhaps you had received the latest news .
if you have not , I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the following release from the German press agency timed at 17.53 hours .
it says : several dozen members of the special police have joined with the demonstrators in Belgrade .
all the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors , have laid down their combat weapons and have allied themselves with the demonstrators .
this was reported on radio index .
apparently at least one police station in the city centre has joined the protestors .
that was the latest at 17.53 hours .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament , possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttresses of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe .
it is of course difficult to determine how long the Serbian population will need to continue fighting before Milosevic will actually disappear off the scene .
a unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important , as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks .
this means , at the same time , that the European Union too will very much need to form a united front .
in this context , I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs , fortunately abandoned by almost all parties in the Lower Chamber , adopted a stance out of the blue which goes against the unity of the European Union and against the wishes of the opposition in Serbia . I believe this displays a lack of earnestness , and is at the same time insulting to his office .
it also signals an excessive drive to stand out from the rest , to the point where the life of people could be at stake .
I believe it is also important to establish at this time on what basis the High Representative and the Council will need to adopt their positions .
will it be by largest common denominator , or on the basis of a large majority in the Council , which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue ?
in addition to establishing unity in the Union , this is also , of course , about recognising the fact that Kostunica has won the presidential elections .
I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people , and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today .
naturally it is difficult to mention budgets at this early stage .
the High Representative explained this only a moment ago , but what we can do is to selectively lift sanctions by way of sending a message to the Serbian electorate .
the neighbouring countries will take a great interest in this too .
I hope that the Council , in conjunction with the Commission , will take clear measures in this respect in the short term .
it is not easy to gauge Serbia &apos; s future .
as we have already witnessed all over Central Europe , constitutional states and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution .
nationalism does not automatically disappear if a democratically elected president can be found .
we should therefore remain level-headed and focused in our attempts to create openings for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe , also from a moral-political point of view .
the debate is closed .
I have received three motions for resolutions , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the vote will take place shortly .
vote
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is as a friend of Israel that I am explaining tonight why I have voted for the joint resolution .
indeed , while I regret a certain ambiguity in the wording and while I do not accept the failure to mention that there is a multitude of Palestinian groups prepared to do anything to wipe out the State of Israel and the Israelis by means of violence and war , it is my very friendship for the Israelis that makes me implore them to end the armed repression against children .
it is also my friendship for Israel and my esteem for the Palestinians that makes me implore them to do everything possible to achieve peace , even if that means great sacrifice on both sides .
their security and their medium- and long-term existence are at stake and no doubt world peace too , at this moment .
Mr President , if you will allow me , I would like to explain why I have abstained in the vote on the resolution regarding the Middle East .
I believe that in delicate matters such as these , preference should be given to a diplomatic stance and , as far as the specific content of paragraph 4 is concerned , it does not comply with the standards for a balanced resolution , in my view .
especially with regard to the committee of inquiry , I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated .
Mr President , there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language versions - in that it only contains the proposed amendments of the GUE group but none of the motions for resolutions and not even the joint text .
that is a serious error .
if I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen , who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert , I would not now know what I was supposed to be voting on .
please ensure that this does not happen again .
statement by the President on Yugoslavia
Mr President , I wish to comment on this morning &apos; s agenda , which , as you know , is particularly lean , even though extremely important events are taking place in Europe and it is most striking that we have held an entire part-session without having a single debate on the single currency .
last week , on 24 September , an extremely important referendum was held , in which the Danes rejected the single currency .
yesterday , the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point , which led to a further fall in the euro &apos; s value .
there are two conclusions to be drawn here . firstly , the public will never take any interest in our debates if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussions on every important issue .
secondly , the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances .
Mr President , I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week .
I would like to congratulate the honourable Members .
we have all been very industrious .
( laughter , applause )
thank you , Mr R√ºbig .
loans for projects in Croatia
Mr President , the European Investment Bank grants loans to non-EU countries , guaranteed by the European Union . the bank guarantees individual loans freely in accordance with its own criteria and not the precise guidelines laid down by the EU .
however , the Union has fixed a ceiling for the loans it guarantees .
the loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65 % of the final total for loans for the period 2000-2007 .
for the rest the bank must itself obtain other forms of security or cover the risk itself .
in practice there is no risk and the European Investment Bank would even be prepared to lower the percentage the EU guarantees .
there is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loans from the EIB .
for each guarantee , funds are transferred from a special reserve into the Guarantee Fund , with a maximum amount decided in the finance frameworks contained in the interinstitutional agreement .
in 2000 a maximum of 204 million euros can be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund .
technically 9 % of the sum for EIB loans should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund , a figure representing 65 % of the nominal value of the loans .
the Guarantee Fund in the budget is also used for macroeconomic aid to non-EU countries .
it is a cheap way for the Member States to grant development aid .
these loans are granted on political grounds to the EU &apos; s humble partners and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by the Guarantee Fund , unlike the Investment Bank loans .
in macroeconomic aid it is often a question of the EU &apos; s share in an overall package in which other sources of aid are the World Bank and the IMF .
generally , financial aid to non-member countries is granted in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criteria set by the IMF - the more guarantees are given for Investment Bank loans , the less macroeconomic aid can be granted , and vice versa .
the Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loans to support the development of core industries in non-member countries , although no transfers from the reserves to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sorts of loans in recent years .
in December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantees for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007 , and produced a list of non-member countries that would be entitled to receive aid .
the European Parliament adopted a position on the matter in a report by Mrs R√ºhle in autumn 1999 .
as Parliament has been heard , the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the terms and conditions of the guarantees .
Parliament must today decide a very simple matter : whether Croatia should join that group of countries to which the European Investment Bank may grant loans with an EU guarantee .
Croatia is no longer at war and democratic change has taken place there .
so there are good grounds for the country joining the group of borrowers , just as there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate .
if Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia &apos; s unemployment and social problems , which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen , but there is no legal basis here for such amendments .
the same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discussed soon in Parliament regarding Turkey joining the group of those countries receiving loan guarantees given by the EU to the European Investment Bank .
Parliament is bound to have a lot of conditions it would like to impose on loans to Turkey , but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word .
today we add Croatia to the list of those receiving guarantees and then it will be Turkey &apos; s turn .
in this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect .
Mr President , this proposal for a Council decision with a view to extending , for the first time , the Community guarantee for the European Investment Bank undoubtedly has a truly extraordinary scope .
before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision , I should like to express our support for it , since it endorses Parliament &apos; s position on relations between the European Union and Croatia .
for this very reason , I wish to state from the outset that I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteur a few minutes ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve , whose narrow margin could cause problems should any unforeseen events occur .
there is one decision that must be put in a dual context . we should consider Croatia &apos; s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view .
we must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there , following the legislative and presidential elections .
the European Union must encourage Croatia to remain firmly grounded in democracy and the rule of law and there is no doubt that this encouragement must be translated into action involving financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the Croatian people to make the necessary sacrifices to balance out the fundamental deficits in their public accounts .
from the operational point of view , I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that has been provided for in the current financial perspective , and the functioning of the Guarantee Fund require an improvement in the mechanisms for achieving the objectives of quality and efficiency in Union loans that are given budgetary guarantees .
in this sense , the rapporteur &apos; s analysis strikes me as being an admirable starting point .
it does not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the EIB .
the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for a series of three-part dialogues to take place within the budgetary procedure .
given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve , which is set at EUR 200 million per year , there is no reason why we should not discuss the priority uses of this margin in coming years .
our aim is clearly to improve the efficiency of the European Investment Bank . in order to achieve this , the Commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of its activities will be carried out .
we cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees .
in the budgetary procedure for 2001 , our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance .
it is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB .
what is clear is that Parliament cannot restrict its role to passively assimilating the information supplied to it by the Commission and the EIB , or to giving its blessing to the decisions of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion , which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia , deals with two important matters .
firstly , the political situation in Croatia has improved dramatically .
the new government is committed to political and economic reform .
that is an opportunity for the European Union to continue once more with cooperation , which was interrupted in 1995 when Croatia began military action in Krajina .
the other message is contained in Croatia &apos; s still very difficult economic situation .
for years the country practised an economic policy based on plundering , which has left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .
the rapporteur , Esko Sepp√§nen , says quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social conditions in Croatia are difficult and the Community &apos; s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension .
an important political change was seen in Croatia in the parliamentary elections that were held earlier this year .
the country &apos; s inhabitants showed by voting that they demanded democratic change .
the new government was made up of a democratic frontline of six parties , which has a firm majority in the country &apos; s parliament .
the government has indicated it is rapidly recognising the values of European democracy and the rule of law .
in foreign relations it gives priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework .
in its programme , the government is committed to such matters as a respect for human rights and the rights of minorities , the repatriation of refugees , improved relations with its neighbours , and considerable economic reform .
legislation is already in place to achieve these aims .
developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relations between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years .
between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place , whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations .
according to the Commission , talks on the Stability and Association Pact with the country should be started as soon as possible .
the Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme , which relates to higher education , should extend to Croatia .
in July the Commission freed 10 million euros to support the repatriation of refugees .
the proposal under discussion contains a target figure of 250 million euros in EIB loans for Croatia for the period 2000-2007 .
with that sum , it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure projects and environmental investment , the development of industry and SMEs , housing reconstruction , urban renewal and tourism .
the plans are in accordance with projects that were put forward by Croatia at the Regional funding Conference held in March .
Croatia &apos; s leaders are committed to difficult but necessary economic reform .
the cure will be hard to endure , but , hopefully , the loans now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effects of economic reform on the lives of the people .
we also have to remember that Croatia has good industrial manufacturing plants , a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunities for the development of tourism , for example .
according to a survey by the Commission the country &apos; s competitiveness in European markets could be strengthened enormously with a raft of consistently applied and ambitious structural reforms , but at present many Croatian businesses still have problems competing in the free economy .
the events in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues .
this week , in the wake of the Presidential elections , we have followed the situation in Yugoslavia with bated breath .
the winds of change are blowing in Belgrade too .
the international community has already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanctions are being lifted .
the European Union and the European Parliament have every reason to support positive developments in the Balkans .
instability in the region is a threat to Europe as a whole .
we know that nationalism and poverty mean war .
ahead of us there is a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also , for our part , have to clear the barriers to effective assistance .
unfortunately , interinstitutional discussions on next year &apos; s budget - in particular section IV on financing - still appear to be very difficult for the time being .
hopefully , the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives .
Mr President , last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there .
in somewhat less dramatic style , Croatia changed governments last year .
in any event , the election victory of the opposition was given the same recognition .
this is why it is possible to pick up where we left off in 1995 .
the chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into , and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year .
a delegation of the European Union has been primed for action , and as you know , the Summit at the end of November will take place precisely in Zagreb , in order to give Croatia the message that the country is welcome in European Union circles .
this is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt .
in its recent past , Croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption .
let us not forget that , until recently , Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand , and which benefited only one individual .
this whole process will need bolstering , which will require enormous investments - investments in infrastructure , in the environment , but also investments in very risky operations .
as we all know , setting up small and medium-sized businesses in that kind of country is risky .
things can go wrong , and this also applies to the reception of refugees , an investment goal which was lacking from the rapporteur &apos; s report , unfortunately .
these too are risky investments .
it is therefore only justified that the mandate of the European Investment Bank will be increased by 250 million .
the European Union is acting as guarantor .
but this is exactly where the problem lies , because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of Serbia , namely the fact that the Council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the Balkans last year in Berlin .
as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I know that the members of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleagues for continually wanting more funds for the Balkans , and for having to enter into negotiations with the Council , which is not always that easy .
but there is very definitely a real problem .
I mentioned it yesterday when we were debating Serbia and I am repeating it here .
it is not acceptable that the rift between the pledges and promises made by the European Union on the one hand , and the reserved funding on the other hand , should be as huge as it is now threatening to become .
having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today , the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow .
I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also , and mainly , the Council , to stick as closely as possible to the Commission &apos; s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years , the reason being that , in my view , the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia , but also in other parts of the Balkans .
I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the Balkans .
I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which is right in saying that this loan is important , but that , in the final analysis , the overall programme , given the necessary financial backing , is more important .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments .
I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance , but political assistance also entails financial support , because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . this can only be achieved , of course , if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere .
there is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed . in the final analysis , the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles .
the contribution under discussion , which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007 , may not prove to be a milestone , but it would certainly help the process on its way .
the course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome .
however , the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved , are something else altogether .
it is generally the case that new political challenges demand increased financial outlay , but not - I might add - at the expense of others .
Mr President , living through these dramatic hours , we look to Belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present us with a real democracy in the course of the next few years .
yet there is still a huge question mark hanging over all this .
we want to support and welcome the process , but we must not get carried away .
Croatia started building a democracy as long as ten years ago .
democratic elections were held there in 1990 , which the international community deemed fair and free .
following these elections the former Communist government , under the leadership of the present Prime Minister , Mr Racan , stepped down in a disciplined manner and a new democratic development began under the Tudjman government . according to the international community though , a few cracks started to develop in this administration , and the situation went downhill from there .
we must now consider the bigger picture .
looking back , not only did this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty years of Communist government - and all Central and Eastern European States , including the candidate states still have their work cut out there - a third of this country was occupied by foreign troops under the dictator Milosevic , who held office at the time and is still in office today .
a third of Croatia was occupied , and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government .
the current administration did not take over under the conditions faced by , what will hopefully be the future government in Belgrade , because the previous government in Croatia stepped down after free and fair elections , and then a new government took office .
it is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation .
Democratisation took place in Croatia ten years ago .
we must also recognise what remarkable achievements there have been over the past ten years in terms of building a market economy , democracy and a constitutional state .
Mr Langendijk is right , some colossal mistakes were made with privatisation .
there was corruption on a massive scale , but if you take a look round the associated countries , the candidate states , you will detect the same trend there .
the current democratic government in Croatia and its democratic opposition , need our full support .
I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payments .
but we must be clear in our own minds that this is only a first step in the right direction .
Mr Markov was right to point out that funds are scarce , and that this can only be a first step .
our aim must be to forge ahead down this path , not just by providing more funds , but , above all , by sending out political signals .
to this end , we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia , which will spell out that this is a European country that has a definite future as a member of the European Union .
I therefore say &apos; yes &apos; to financial aid , and &apos; yes &apos; to this guarantee , but , at the same time , would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European , and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country , and to include it in the list of candidate countries , because I believe Croatia has earned our full support .
this could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to its rejuvenation .
Mr President , these days , we cannot talk about Croatia without seeing it in the context of its neighbour Serbia , where the people are now finally throwing off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique . a clique which referred to itself as socialist , but managed to stay in power for more than ten years by using fascist methods alone .
along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence , this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-√†-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country .
the same formula has been applied in Croatia over the past ten years . Croatia is not one of the states we have been discussing this week as being potential future candidate states of the Union .
in many respects , the position of that country is the same as that of Slovakia , which is now a candidate state .
up until 1918 , both regions were rebellious sections of Hungary and boasted their own language , culture and identity , but were thwarted by the official state authority .
international pressure forced them thereafter not to become fully independent , but to join new large collective states which were intended as melting pots for minor Slavonic peoples , but they never managed to integrate properly .
when half a century ago , Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time , they became vassals of the Hitler regime .
in 1945 , the outside world agreed that these states should cease to exist permanently .
with the benefit of hindsight , this was a silly move .
ignoring the wish of those peoples to be able to make independent decisions , provided the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for years , a nationalism which had little consideration for the tragic legacy left by the Nazi era and which was hostile towards other peoples and democracy at home .
people hid behind Tudjman and Meciar because they saw this as the only guarantee for being treated as equals vis-√†-vis their neighbours who used to rule over them .
it is only now that all their reasonable demands have been met and nobody doubts the right to independence any longer , that nationalism is fading away and normal political alliances are emerging .
the nationalists recently lost political power in both countries .
this could serve as a lesson for other strongly nationalist regions .
the only way to eradicate nationalism is to meet all reasonable demands of those nationalists .
there is now every reason for treating Croatia in the same way as Slovakia and other Central European countries which can join the European Union if they so wish .
the damage done by the war has not yet been cleared , as we witnessed recently .
the country &apos; s road infrastructure is vulnerable because Dalmatia and Slavonia form the two halves of a pair of scissors , as it were , with Bosnia being wedged in the middle , which , particularly in West Herzegovina , is also populated by Croats .
the environment in the large population concentrations in Zagreb , Rijeka and Osijek is at risk .
this set of circumstances will probably necessitate huge investments , which will not be repaid until later on in the form of tourism and new industry .
this is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangements at this stage .
along with the rapporteur , I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms , especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union &apos; s budget is not being increased .
there is little point in the European Union making pledges to crisis areas and candidate states left , right and centre , which it cannot meet .
as far as Croatia is concerned , there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement .
the comment which my colleague Mr Papayannakis made yesterday about admitting Serbia to the European Union should also apply to Croatia .
there is another individual measure that has been well received today .
of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade .
we must immediately appeal to the military and the police , in no uncertain terms , to throw their full weight behind democracy , and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which was triggered by the outcome of democratic elections - proceeds peacefully over the next few hours .
we have every intention of recognising these democratic elections and the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica .
of course my country , Austria , in common with all the other European countries , will also have to do its bit towards the reconstruction of Yugoslavia , in tandem with the European Union .
we will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanctions against former Yugoslavia is implemented in full .
our honourable friend , Mr Posselt , was correct in what he said about the developments in Croatia .
but we are all agreed , nonetheless , that the parliamentary and presidential elections that took place in January 2000 have produced a new political climate .
the new government has reinforced its commitment to political and economic reform .
this will have a positive effect on relations between Croatia and the EU .
the European Union &apos; s response to this development has been not only to appoint the advisory EU-Croatia Task Force , but also to develop the office of the special representative in Zagreb into a permanent representative office of the European Commission .
in the feasibility report on a stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia , compiled in May 2000 , the Commission reaches the conclusion that the conditions for taking up negotiations with Croatia have been fulfilled .
the delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own , have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate .
the Council held in June established that all the preconditions to commencing negotiations on a stabilisation and Association Agreement had been meet .
in July , the European Commission forwarded the draft of a negotiating mandate to the Member States , for them to comment on .
Austria , the country I come from , was one of the first three Member States , to make a positive statement .
the reason I mention this development in the year 2000 , after the election , is because it shows that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund .
we have already come a long way .
we must single-mindedly pursue the process that started in May and July as far as an Association Agreement .
Croatia and the region deserve this in the interests of peace within Europe .
Mr President , first of all I must declare a personal interest , I have a son-in-law who was , and is , a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia .
even if it is now technically possible to return , much more has to be done to make the return of Serbs to Croatia and the Krajina in particular positively welcome .
much physical restoration is required in that sad part of Croatia .
we in the European Union must insist that this is positively encouraged and not just a nominal gesture .
our financial contributions should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the Commission that this aspect will be taken into account .
my second point refers to Serbia itself .
even if there is the happy , democratic outcome , which we hope for in Serbia , there will still be great resentment resulting from what happened with the Kosovo campaign and our recent relationships with Serbia .
this will not be overcome immediately .
we in Europe must be prepared to rise above any peevish reactions to those sentiments .
the top priority , not just for Serbia but for all the Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania , is to restore normal transport links in the whole area and bring Serbia with all its hurts back into the European fold .
I am grateful , on behalf of the Commission , to Mr Sepp√§nen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing Community guarantee for European Investment Bank lending outside the Union to cover interventions in Croatia .
as the House will know and as has been remarked again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential elections early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate .
we celebrate that and we act as a Community to support it .
but I cannot let this debate pass without referring to another part of former Yugoslavia which is beginning the century with hope and the prospect of freedom .
I am speaking of the glorious revolution taking place now in Serbia , thanks to the courage of the Serbian people and their insistence on democracy .
the House will know that the Commission has made it crystal clear that European Union sanctions will stop with the advent of democratic government in Serbia .
when it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed , we hope that action to establish normal relations and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracies will only be days away .
meanwhile the new government in Croatia is clearly demonstrating its serious commitment to putting that country on a secure democratic path and to implementing the political and economic reforms necessary to adhere to the conditions of the European Union stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans .
taking account of those advances last May , the Commission produced a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia and on 19 July recommended opening negotiations .
this constitutes a major step forward in EU-Croatia bilateral relations .
the Commission hopes that a decision can be taken in November so that negotiations can start without too much delay .
it is also essential for the Community to provide appropriate financial support for Croatia .
the resumption of EIB lending is intended to assist the country &apos;s investment activities in infrastructure and private sector development .
the new Croatian leadership clearly needs dependable and sustained backing to pursue demanding reforms .
the proposal before the House would cover up to EUR 250 million of lending over the next four years .
as Mr Purvis has just said - and I fully acknowledge - that must be regarded as part of a process of normalisation , stabilisation and progress that extends over many years .
the rapporteur has not proposed any amendments .
I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent .
( applause )
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
explanations of vote
Mr President , I wanted to be here not just to state that I voted for this aid for Croatia but , above all , to have the chance to express my satisfaction , as others have today , at the democratic events taking place in Serbia at the moment .
after many years of difficulties for this people - all kinds of difficulties - we are at last , extremely democratically , beginning to welcome Serbia back into the community of the peoples of the European Union .
I hope that negotiations will soon get underway and , as with Croatia , that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people , who deserve our greatest respect .
thank you , Mr Fatuzzo .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( the sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m. )
resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000 .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Madam President , the Minutes of the Parliamentary sitting tell us that the issue was raised in this Chamber of the racist attack made on a teacher in Verona .
the Minutes also say that Parliament condemned the incident and , in particular , expressed its solidarity with the teacher .
I would like to inform you that the teacher in question invented the whole story and has confessed that he was not the victim of an attack at all but that his wounds were self-inflicted .
what this amounts to is that we have all been taken for a ride .
I just wanted to inform you of this , seeing that this hoodwinking of Parliament by the teacher from Verona is recorded in the Minutes .
Mr Speroni , this information does not , most probably , require any amendment to the Minutes , but I take note of your comment nonetheless .
are there any further comments on the Minutes ?
( the Minutes were approved )
statements by the President
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , since our last part-session , a fortnight ago , three more people have been shot and killed by ETA .
let me mention their names and , in commemorating them , express our compassion and sympathy at this time of sadness to the members of their families : Luis Portero , Chief Public Prosecutor of the Regional Court of Andalucia , murdered in Granada on 9 October ;
Antonio Munos Carignanos , a colonel and doctor in the Spanish air force , murdered in Seville on 16 October ;
Maximo Casado , a prison service employee , murdered yesterday morning in Vitoria .
it is on behalf of the whole House that I express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these people .
these victims take the number of ETA murder victims since the cease-fire was broken on 3 December 1999 to a total of sixteen .
even if we cannot find the words to express our response to such a tragedy , we must not give up the fight by any means .
quite the opposite .
as we have always done on each of these sad occasions , we must , once again , condemn this intolerable behaviour .
the right to life is sacrosanct .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , which was approved in Biarritz by unanimous decision of the Heads of State and Government , reaffirms this most categorically .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to pay tribute to these victims by observing a minute &apos; s silence , and to lend our support to the authorities and to democrats in Spain in their fight against this scourge , a fight that often puts their lives in jeopardy .
thank you for observing a minute &apos; s silence .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
o
o o
President .
unfortunately , I must again take the floor to pay tribute to the memory of all those who have been victims of the upsurge of hatred and xenophobia in the Middle East .
tomorrow , this House will discuss this sensitive issue as part of its debate on the Biarritz European Council , but today I should just like to express my deep sadness at a phenomenon that we find disturbing in the extreme , since it is a tragic illustration of the baleful influence of the extremists on both sides .
on behalf of all the Members of this House , I would express our deepest sympathies to all the members of the families of the victims of this conflict , and further express my solidarity with all the people wounded in the conflicts .
I hope , moreover , that the advocates of peace and dialogue will ultimately succeed in prevailing over those that incite to violence and hatred .
o
o o
President .
finally , as you know , several days ago , torrential rain caused unprecedented damage in Switzerland and Italy , resulting in the deaths of twenty-five people , injuring many more , and occasioning extensive material damage .
the day before yesterday , in Spain , heavy rain and flooding was also to blame for the deaths of three people , with three others reported missing .
I should like , on behalf of the European Parliament , to express our distress at these events and to offer the families of the victims our deepest sympathy . if you agree , I shall once again ask you to observe a minute &apos; s silence in honour of these victims .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
... I explained , then , that speakers on procedural motions would be cut off after one minute , as expressly stipulated in the Rules of Procedure , in Rule 141 , to be precise .
I should just like to point that out .
your applause today , as well as the applause I heard on the Tuesday of the last part-session , confirms that you endorse this approach .
Madam President , it is quite right that the municipal elections in Himara were marked by violence and fraud at the expense of the Greek minority living there .
that this happened is beyond question .
we have the findings of international organisations which monitored the elections .
Albania is a country whose own minorities have suffered persecution at the hands of other countries and , as we all know , the international community reacted to this persecution .
it should not repeat inside its borders what it suffered outside its borders ; that is , I think , the first lesson in democracy which we should bring to the attention of this country , which is starting to establish an internal democracy .
I should like the European Parliament to take note of these violations and , of course , to call for repeat elections in Himara .
we will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation . our intention is to build bridges of peace between women in places where violence prevails .
Madam President , I would just like to inform the two Greek speakers that the next meeting of the south-eastern Europe delegation - in the course of which we will also receive representatives from Albania - will also address this issue , and I am certain that with Mrs Pack in the chair , we will approach the matter objectively .
Madam President , last week , the MEP Karla Peijs was attacked in Brussels .
I would urge you to approach the Belgian Government again and to see to it that security levels are stepped up in Brussels .
indeed , Mr R√ºbig , I shall do so .
Madam President , I have a question concerning the statute for Members .
my question is : who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this statute ?
I ask because when I read the public statements made by our colleague , Mr Rothley , I get the impression that we have appointed a saboteur and not a rapporteur .
I hope that you are speaking for Parliament rather than Mr Rothley .
Madam President , I understand that you will shortly be announcing the decision of the French Government to terminate my mandate as a Member of the European Parliament .
I believe that this is a grave injustice and a penalty which is out of all proportion to the minor incidents which served as a pretext for it .
I received no notice in order to prepare my defence .
I was not permitted to waive my parliamentary immunity and I did not have the benefit of any of the defences that even a guilty party would have .
I believe that the European Parliament has the opportunity in this case to , perhaps , demonstrate its ability to come to the defence of its own dignity .
Madam President , there are more victims of ETA , but there are also more victims of the Spanish repression : more arrests , more people tortured , new dispersals of political prisoners jailed in the Basque country .
all in all there has been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards ; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict .
it is not surprising if they express their profound dismay more and more clearly because , with the exception of the Spanish Government , no one believes in the benefits of the ongoing strategy .
can the European Parliament give up hope of ever finding a democratic . . .
( the President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I do not wish to be repetitive , but the situation requires it .
you are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar , where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine .
as we have feared and supposed since the start , according to the technicians , the significance of the damage is increasing daily with the passage of time .
I ask you , Madam President , to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation , in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection .
Madam President , firstly , I would like to speak as chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to point out , following on from what Mr Haarder said , that Mr Rothley , first Vice-Chairman of the Committee , is not a spokesman but a rapporteur , and I think that so far he has conducted himself impeccably within that mandate .
secondly , I would like to speak in support of Mrs Morgantini &apos; s motion .
I think we are at a stage in the process in the Middle East in which dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli female Members of Parliament and European female Members of Parliament could contribute to resolving this conflict .
Madam President , if I have understood correctly , we are at present establishing our Agenda .
our Rules of Procedure do not admit any points of order at this juncture .
according to the Rules of Procedure , we are allowed procedural motions pursuant to Rule 141 and points of order with reference to the Rules of Procedure pursuant to Rule 142 , but not , in any manner of speaking , points of order , especially not to make the kind of representations we have just heard .
apparently , just anyone can stand up and say whatever they want when the Agenda comes up .
when oh when , Madam President , are you going to apply the Rules of Procedure and nothing but the Rules of Procedure ?
let me answer you , Mr Goebbels .
this is a problem that everyone chairing a sitting has to deal with .
the problem is determining whether a matter is grounds for a procedural motion or not .
I feel that if we stop to discuss whether , every time a Member wishes to speak on a procedural motion , it actually complies with the Rules of Procedure or not , then we shall waste a great deal of time .
I think applying the minute rule is the least damaging solution , in the final analysis , as we have , in fact , seen .
Madam President , you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner , James Mawdsley , who was held illegally by the Burmese authorities .
you promised to convey your concern , and subsequently this House passed a resolution condemning his imprisonment .
that was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley was released by the Burmese authorities last week .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you and Members of this House for the part you played in seeing this process through to a successful conclusion .
I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousands of other people who are political prisoners in Burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country .
Madam President , when my fellow Danish MEP , Mr Bertel Haarder , spoke a little while ago , his Danish was so garbled that it was completely impossible to understand what he was saying .
could you not make sure that we can hear what he is saying in future ?
it was really difficult to understand his Danish .
Madam President , last Monday , Antonio Russo , the radio Radicale correspondent , was found dead in Georgia with his chest caved in . he was the only Western journalist to remain in Pristina , in Kosovo , for a number of weeks last year .
the autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he was the victim of murder and had , in all probability , been tortured .
Antonio Russo , a courageous journalist , was investigating the crimes taking place in Chechnya , and it is our opinion that this was the reason for his tragic death .
I know that it would not be usual for Parliament to hold another minute &apos;s silence - and I would not be so bold as to propose this - but I wanted you to be informed of the development , for Antonio Russo was a journalist and a very brave man who gave his life for the freedom of information for all people .
Madam President , pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 7 ( 4 ) of our Rules of Procedure , the President is bound to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before ratifying the decision of the French Government .
the Council of State ruling , which you will perhaps be invoking as a defence very shortly , was issued by a body which has no jurisdiction in the matter , whereas French law stipulates that only plenary is competent to rule on the subject of the mandate of a Member of the European Parliament .
in the course of this procedure , Madam President , the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member , Jean-Marie le pen , has been violated from start to finish .
I do not see how you can cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as you did a short time ago , without actually implementing it in the exercise of your office .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the topic of violence is given priority status in this Parliament and that is how it should continue to be .
further to your appeal and your expression of sympathy with the families of the victims of violence , we too would like to show our solidarity with all those who are protesting today against the violence of ETA in so many places in the Basque country .
that is why , after approval of this agenda , we intend to hold a small , peaceful demonstration , which will take a few minutes , in front of the Parliament building , together with all colleagues and delegates in this House who wish to attend .
Madam President , it is not possible to let Mr Gollnisch impugn the supreme administrative court in France without responding . if he respected the rule of law , he would respect its jurisdiction .
as for Mr le pen , what an affront to the dignity of the European Parliament and for any true democrat to hear Mr le pen using the word &apos; dignity &apos; !
Madam President , I have a genuine point of order .
we have no urgent procedures this week , yet , Chechnya , Albania , Burma and Palestine have already been discussed .
my question to you is this : can we not change the Rules of Procedure in such a way that we no longer have urgent procedures , but deal with these matters at the beginning of the sittings instead ?
( applause )
do you see , Mr Goebbels ? is this actually a procedural motion or not ?
believe me , we could spend hours and hours debating the point .
Madam President , between 3 October 2000 and yesterday , at least seven memorials were desecrated , eight people were subjected to racist attacks , four hostels for asylum seekers were set upon , and seven synagogues , Jewish cemeteries or memorials were desecrated in the Federal Republic of Germany .
just because , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business .
a number of Members of Parliament have had a fantastic dream , this I can understand .
they have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli , for instance , or turning our Treaties into a constitution .
well , today , acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the European Parliament is subject to a State , regardless of which one this is , and has a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow Members , would be to admit that Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authorities .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream , one I do not , however , personally share .
simply by acknowledging that the European Parliament has the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate , you will have gone some way towards achieving your federal dream . otherwise , Madam President , in yielding to the authority of others , you are effectively taking a step backwards .
a whole series of violations of the law - not just French law , but also European law - have taken place and I feel it would be a grave mistake not to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market or to hear Mr le pen &apos; s side of the case .
agenda
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 19 October 2000 has been distributed .
relating to Monday : I have received a request from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance to defer Mrs Klass &apos; s report , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine , to a later part-session .
Mr Lannoye wishes to speak as the author of this request .
Madam President , Mrs Klass &apos; s report has already been deferred twice .
we would , however , like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons .
the fact is , this apparently technical report , which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature , is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture .
we think , given that for the moment we are at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on GMOs , that it would be wiser to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceedings and to deal with this problem once the framework has been clearly defined , which should , in principle , be in the month of January .
we therefore propose postponing examination of this report .
Mr Lannoye has just presented his Group &apos; s request .
is there a speaker to support this request ?
Madam President , as we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly , there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms , namely the report by David Bowe , which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure .
this is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants .
it is therefore only sensible , and indeed , right and proper , to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure , which will not be for another six weeks or so , and then take decisions on all the other pieces of legislation .
I therefore support Mr Lannoye &apos; s amendment .
we shall now hear from the rapporteur , Mrs Klass , who , I believe , is opposed to postponing the report .
Madam President , I am against postponing the report , and I question the way in which this House works .
the report was adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a good majority and with only two votes against .
we are now embarking on a discussion about the release directive 90 / 220 , which is inappropriate .
we are referring here to the release directive , and according to the conciliation procedure , that is precisely what the speeches will focus on .
we are doing exactly the same as we have already done in the case of forest and plant material , i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive .
not voting on the report will lead to delays .
it will obstruct the trade in vine material in Europe , and so I believe that in the interests of the single market for Europe &apos; s vine propagators , we must vote on our report .
( Parliament rejected the request )
relating to Tuesday :
Madam President , on behalf of my Group , I would like to move that a particular item be included in tomorrow morning &apos; s debate , namely a statement from the Commission about an interview that Commissioner Verheugen gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last Friday , 20 October .
Mr Verheugen gave the impression that , according to the current state of play , the European Union will have ten new members by 2005 and , what is more , and this is more disturbing still , he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the Council of Ministers , which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the nice Summit .
he has already been criticised within his own political circles for saying this .
we would urge the Commission to clarify matters tomorrow in its statement .
Regrettably , this is now the second time that Commissioner Verheugen has said such contentious things .
he is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it .
we urge the Commission to clarify its position .
Mr Poettering , in tomorrow &apos; s debate , every speaker will be free to raise any issue and to address both the Council and the Commission .
announcement of the removal of Mr le pen from office
ladies and gentlemen , I must inform you that on Thursday , 19 October 2000 , I received official notification from the competent authorities of the French Republic of a ruling by the Council of State on 6 October 2000 rejecting the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie le pen against the decree of the French Prime Minister on 31 March 2000 terminating his mandate as an elected representative to the European Parliament .
I must inform you that , since that time , I have received a copy of a request for clemency for Mr le pen presented to Mr Jacques Chirac , President of the French Republic , by Mr Charles de Gaulle , Mr Carl Lang , Mr Jean-Claude Martinez and Mr Bruno Gollnisch .
I shall give the floor to Mrs Ana Palacio Vallelersundi , chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , to give us her views on the matter .
Madam President , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having deliberated at its sitting of 15 and 16 May , agreed to recommend that the announcement in plenary of Parliament &apos; s confirmation of the removal of Mr Jean-Marie le pen &apos; s mandate be suspended .
I repeat , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that Mr le pen was given for appealing against the French Council of State had expired or until a decision by the latter .
and I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself , Madam President , read in plenary .
as you said , the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection .
there is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary , which is an obligatory act according to primary law , specifically paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976 .
the request for a reprieve that you mentioned , Madam President , does not alter this situation , as it is not a legal appeal .
as its name indicates , it is an act of the Prince , which does not affect the decree from the French Government which , in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , must be announced in plenary .
thank you , Mrs Palacio .
consequently , pursuant to Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Act of 20 September 1976 on the election of representatives to the European parliament by direct universal suffrage , the European Parliament hereby takes note of the notification by the French Government of the termination of Mr Jean-Marie le pen &apos; s mandate .
Mr le pen , please leave the Chamber forthwith . in order to ensure that these proceedings go ahead in an orderly manner without affecting the dignity of either this House or your own dignity , I propose to suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
( the sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m. )
request for waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity
the next item is the report ( A5-0304 / 2000 ) by Mr MacCormick , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the request for the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity .
Madam President , this issue arises from a request ( announced by yourself to the House on 17 February ) by the appropriate Portuguese authorities seeking a waiver of the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira in respect of proceedings in Portugal concerning words spoken on a television programme some years ago .
the television programme involved a discussion about the respective roles of politicians and journalists .
Mr Pacheco Pereira in that debate made remarks about a third party not participating in the debate , to which the third party took exception .
initially , public criminal proceedings were initiated but these were dropped and there is now a private action taking place before the Cascais First Criminal Court .
this is therefore a case involving the exercise of freedom of speech in a political matter .
the immunities of Members of the House arise under Article 10 of the Protocol of the privileges and Immunities of the European Communities .
the substance of this , for our present purpose , is that Members of this Parliament enjoy in their own Member State the same immunities as would be enjoyed by members of the national parliament of the state in question .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having looked into the matter , is satisfied that , upon an issue of the kind before us , Mr Pacheco Pereira , were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament , would enjoy immunity which could be waived only by the Portuguese Parliament .
therefore , under our rules , he enjoys immunity which can be waived only by decision of this Parliament .
it is important that I should underline the point that immunity is not conceived as an advantage to a particular Member , which she or he may waive or assert as she or he chooses .
rather , it is an immunity asserted by this House as a whole , in the interests of preserving the conditions of effective , democratic politics and argument and of enabling this House , through its Members , to discharge its function properly in an all-Europe democracy .
therefore it is for the House to decide whether the immunity ought to waived or not .
we do not do this arbitrarily .
we do it in accordance with precedence and practice established over many years .
the concluding section of my report ought to be read out : &quot; it is indisputable that Dr Pacheco &apos; s comments on a television programme on the press qualify as part of a political debate and therefore paragraph 1 of Article 157 of the Portuguese constitution would be applicable .
under that provision he would have enjoyed immunity were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament .
accordingly , he does enjoy immunity as a Member of the European Parliament in respect of statements made and opinions expressed in the television programme to which the case relates . &quot;
it has been the practice of the House to insist upon upholding immunity in all cases where to deny it would be to inhibit political activity of a legitimate and democratic kind .
on that ground , therefore , the Legal Affairs Committee has unanimously come to the conclusion that , after considering the reasons militating for or against the waiver of immunity , we recommend that the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira not be waived by Parliament .
Madam President , the case of Mr Pacheco Pereira has been carefully examined by the Legal Affairs Committee : the recommendation , which was approved and which is tabled before the House today , is not to reject the request for waiver of Parliamentary immunity .
the reference made in the Protocol to national legislation does not mean that the European Parliament is being passed over but is in connection with the procedure , while every Parliament - including , in the case in point , the European Parliament - preserves its authority in its autonomous decisions .
when all is said and done , Mr Pacheco Pereira was performing a political activity and cannot therefore be considered responsible for any crime .
that is the position of the European People &apos; s Party . we would also like to point out that , if Mr Pacheco Pereira had been Italian , proceedings would have been brought against him without the European Parliament knowing anything about it .
the Italian judiciary does not ask for authorisation when the person in question is a Member of the European Parliament and ignores every principle of the respect due to this institution .
some Members of Parliament have already been taken to court during this parliamentary term without a request being put forward for waiver of parliamentary immunity .
personally , I was not able to intervene to condemn these actions in that it concerned members of my own party who have always been political targets , and my involvement would therefore have appeared exploitative .
however , the incident has been repeated again , and this time , although the Member concerned is a member of the European People &apos; s Party , he is not from the same political party or persuasion as I am in Italy .
proceedings were brought against Mr Cocilovo without Parliament being informed , indeed in contempt of Parliament .
this is an extremely serious matter , Madam President , that you cannot ignore .
the autonomy of the European Parliament is at stake !
Madam President , I certainly do not require the two minutes allocated to me because , after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr Zappal√† , from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament , there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity should not be waived .
I would say that this is a really trivial issue , a few comments by a politician on a television programme , which have resulted in a criminal action that has no grounds , and which are covered by the Portuguese constitution and by application of Community rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity .
in short , here we have all the ingredients for Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and , therefore , the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with Mr MacCormick &apos; s proposal that Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended .
social policy agenda
the next item is the report ( A5-0291 / 2000 ) by Mrs Van Lancker , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission communication to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 ( COS ) &#93; .
it has often been said that &apos; social policy is a productive factor &apos; and this is true , for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better .
however , social policy does have its own rights ; social policy must ensure that inequalities are ironed out , that social cohesion is promoted and that people &apos; s quality of life improves .
that is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in European policy .
the Lisbon Summit has given us the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy ; we must seize that opportunity with both hands .
it was with great delight that I noted that the Commission and the French Presidency want an ambitious social agenda , and I believe , Commissioner and Minister , that we fully endorse the objectives .
I would therefore like to use some of my speaking time in this debate to draw attention to a number of points which Parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda .
the first point relates to the strategy . the social agenda must raise the profile of social Europe among the citizens , and that is why we are in favour of defining measures , priorities and instruments more clearly and with greater intensity .
we must be able to see where progress is being made ; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level .
hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard , similar to the one already in use in the internal market , which details specific measures , expiry dates and deadlines .
hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussions at the annual spring Summit .
secondly , I would like to comment on the instruments .
it is true that the open method of coordination , which has been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg , has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority .
we would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty .
furthermore , we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security .
thirdly , there is a &apos; but &apos; .
stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation , because we should lay down social rights in Europe too . we should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market .
Parliament is of the opinion that the Commission could lend a helping hand here and there , for example where individual and collective workers &apos; rights are concerned , where more security in new types of labour are concerned , or as regards the protection of health and safety relating to new risks in the workplace .
in addition , we believe it is crucial that the European Commission should take the initiative to re-establish the link with the &apos; 92 recommendations in order to underpin Member States &apos; efforts to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income .
only then can the fight against poverty be efficient .
needless to say , the social partners are major players when it comes to achieving this agenda , where lifelong learning is concerned for example , or the organisation of working time , and new forms of work , and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields .
however , Commissioner , if this consultation does not yield results , we would also ask the Commission to use its right of initiative to the full .
I would like to finish off by making two remarks : as we endeavour to achieve the European social agenda it is essential to establish a close partnership , a partnership between institutions , and with the Member States , the social partners , but also with the many social NGOs which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda .
here too , we believe that Europe should take an initiative as a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizens and the dialogue with the social NGOs .
finally , social policy should not be viewed in isolation . it must be integrated into all EU policies .
I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy , competition policy , external policy and the entire enlargement discussion .
I hope , Minister , that the Council will be inspired by Parliament &apos; s expectations , and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the nice Summit for a European social agenda , which we can work towards together over the next couple of years .
Mr President , the proposed social agenda sent out a political message which did not go unheeded .
this issue provoked intense interest in societies throughout Europe and the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights has taken account in its opinion of the numerous proposals submitted by representatives of non-governmental organisations and civil society in general .
we hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizens the chance to feel part of social Europe and to realise that the European Union intends to take positive action to continue raising standards of living , rather than merely guaranteeing minimum levels .
the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection .
we must not forget that women are always the first to fall prey to economic crises and the majority of our fellow citizens who are victims of social exclusion and poverty are women .
in our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society , especially women &apos; s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family , because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe .
before I give Mrs P√©ry the floor , on behalf of the Council , I have a few comments to make .
this is Mrs P√©ry &apos; s third visit in succession to Parliament , and we welcome this .
that was the first point I wanted to make .
the only explanation I have for this is that the culprit is always drawn back to the scene of the crime .
Mrs P√©ry was Vice-President for some years , sat in this very chair , and we were always in a very safe pair of hands during difficult votes .
all the more reason why I am delighted to see you here today , Mrs P√©ry .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteurs , ladies and gentlemen of the House , let me firstly thank you , Mr President , for this personalised introduction .
I am very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda .
I must also say , however , that Elisabeth Guigou , the current Minister for Employment and Social Affairs , would have liked to have been able to attend proceedings here today in this institution to which she too once belonged and of which she has fond memories , but her new duties require her to be in Paris today , and she has therefore asked me to present her apologies .
before going any further , I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and its chairman , on the report before us today , which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda .
following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris , the Presidency invited all the parties involved , the European Parliament , of course , the Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , both sides of industry , NGOs , Council groups and committees , to submit their proposals .
the European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise .
the French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work .
the informal Council meeting of 8 July , the September conference you hosted with the European Commission and Mr Briet &apos; s tour of European capitals have provided the basis for a number of comments .
let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas , in a very succinct way , as befits my allotted speaking time .
I am happy to be able to say that all the parties involved in social policy declared themselves in favour of drawing up an agenda .
this is intended to give a higher profile to European social policy and to make it more effective , preparing the European Union for the great shared challenges ahead .
the agenda is , of course , in keeping with the Lisbon conclusions and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights , to ensure its effective implementation .
the areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement .
what debates there were did not involve the type of action to be undertaken but rather the method to be adopted in order to achieve the desired objectives .
I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rifts .
as you very rightly suggest in your resolution , thereby supporting the approach proposed by the European Commission , we shall continue to use the entire range of Community instruments available to us : social dialogue , legislation , coordination , convergence , information exchange and financing under Community funds and programmes .
it is up to us to determine , area by area and action by action , the instruments best suited to the desired objective .
I now come to my more specific comments , and firstly my comments on employment .
employment is our number one priority , even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux .
here , too , I noted unanimity on the need to continue and step up the Luxembourg process in the context of the objectives established at the European Council in Lisbon .
we are particularly committed to the objective of full employment .
it is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality , and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective : more jobs and better jobs .
it falls to us to define the key elements which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measuring these .
you will understand , given my duties as a member of the French Government , that I was particularly pleased to note that , firstly , the equality of men and women and , secondly , lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support .
the subject of lifelong training was unanimously adopted as a priority area .
moreover , the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject .
we must encourage them to do so in order to ensure that initiatives by collective agreement are taken to promote lifelong training within the shortest possible time limits .
let me , at this point , remind you that there will be a European seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz , which I shall be chairing .
on the subject of the equality of men and women , many Member States stressed the need for a better coordination of work and family life , particular with regard to childcare .
this is indeed a key issue , both in order to increase employment rates and in order to make progress towards male-female equality .
to stay on this subject a moment , your resolution provides for many measures in favour of women and contains one general objective to include the concept of male-female equality in all the sectors covered by the agenda .
I support this method .
as you perhaps know , on 27 October , I am holding a ministerial symposium on this subject .
I already spoke at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on October 5 .
I shall not therefore remind you of the three areas that we shall be debating at this meeting .
you will shortly be discussing the fifth gender equality programme for 2001-2006 .
I should like to thank you most sincerely for responding to the Presidency &apos; s invitation by working very quickly and very successfully , enabling us to adopt this most important programme , which proposes both an integrated approach and specific actions , on time .
you can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million .
finally , in order to step up the integrated approach to equality , the Presidency was in favour of implementing this concept in a number of meetings of the Council of Ministers .
this is something that will be done under the French Presidency .
the social agenda has many more objectives .
let me just mention the mobility of workers .
freedom of movement must be encouraged , while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded .
I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment . this must be dealt with better .
both sides of industry pointed out the need for common definitions .
I am thinking in particular of non-standard work .
plainly , a number of Community Directives on European works councils , transfers and mass redundancies , for example , need to be updated .
I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment , particularly concerning health and safety .
existing directives must be simplified and adapted to technical progress , but practical proposals must also be made on emerging risks or dangerous jobs .
let me say something about social protection .
we all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection , paying special attention , as we were urged at Lisbon , to the issue of Pensioners .
at the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October , a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion , which will serve as a foundation for national action plans .
the agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources .
within the next few weeks , the Presidency intends to draw up a general report on all these subjects , in the light of the contributions submitted to us .
we should be able to successfully complete a document intended for the Heads of State and Government by the time of the Employment Council on 28 November . this document should express some real ambitions for the next five years .
quite clearly , the European Parliament will have made a significant contribution , and I thank you for this .
Mr President , today we are debating social policy .
I would like to warmly thank Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kratsa for the huge effort they have made in order to set down thoughts from within Parliament on paper .
I would like to make two observations in this regard .
firstly , we used to debate the social action programme , and an action programme implies that something is done .
we are now discussing the social agenda and this could mean that something is done , but not necessarily , and so this is one of the aspects which we need to continually bear in mind .
we are dealing with a Socialist-inspired Council , so chances are that there will be a lot of talk and little action .
I hope I will be proved wrong .
what matters is that something is put on the agenda and that something is done .
this is the aim of this report and we have tried to emphasise this in a number of amendments .
today we are discussing social policy , as the rapporteur pointed out earlier .
in our Group , we have always set great store by the social market economy as a basis for everything we do , also within the framework of the European Union .
fortunately , we have largely managed to bring about the common market .
we have also managed to bring about a few things in the social sphere , but not everything , and this was because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time ; so , in this light , the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance .
we need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system , and at least put them on the agenda .
the importance of drafting an agenda is that we can include items which we hope the Commission will develop further .
a number of such points are included .
it would have been very wrong on the part of this Parliament not to make any mention of these points , but I am aware that we have not yet solved all the problems related to these points .
it is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination .
I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial . in fact , I would also like to refer to the recommendation made by Mr Cocilovo , which admittedly is not being discussed here but which will be voted on later .
in particular , his recommendation responds to Parliament &apos; s observations on employment .
this is why little mention is made of this in the present report .
however , these two recommendations should actually be seen as one entity for the picture to be complete .
I think there are some problems left unsolved , but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on producing an excellent report .
I have heard from some quarters that having read the report , they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription .
I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis is not good for the stated aim of the social agenda , which is to make sure that social policy has a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy .
this is the prescription we need to follow .
for the Socialist Group there are many very important points in this report .
for us the open coordination method is very important .
we want to see it strengthened in relation to employment .
we want to see it also applied to social exclusion and social protection .
I am glad to hear what Nicole Perry had to say to us today in that respect .
open coordination seems to be regarded by many as a soft option and I have no doubt that is why it is being supported in certain quarters .
it cannot be a soft option .
we will insist at every possible opportunity that it has to entail indicators and benchmarks and proper peer-group review and that there should be a part for Parliament in that procedure .
we also support social dialogue but we insist that the Commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiations fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary .
paragraph 14 lists a number of points we think are important .
I cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for us the importance of those paragraphs relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring .
again I was pleased to hear what Nicole Perry has said today .
I have not heard similarly encouraging things so far from the Commission in relation to , for example , the need to update the European Works Council Directive , or relating to collective redundancies and transfers .
we also , of course , place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relating to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change is managed with social responsibility .
Mr President , as far as the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is concerned , it is crucial that the Europe of the future should also be a social Europe .
the political task is therefore to find the best way of achieving that objective .
for us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , it is important that decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible . this applies especially to labour market and social policy .
at the Lisbon Summit this spring , the EU &apos; s Heads of Government adopted a far-sighted vision for the development of a social Europe . importance was attached to promoting the EU &apos; s position in the knowledge society , as it was to open coordination in pursuit of common objectives , but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resources .
this was established as a leading principle .
in its communication , the Commission has found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit .
in our view , open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe .
there may be a need for legislation in some areas , but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rules which bring European cooperation into discredit without producing real results .
I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which Mrs Van Lancker has put into drawing up the report .
her contribution has been very constructive , and if my Group is sceptical about a number of the main elements in her report , that is because we disagree politically , and that is , of course , understandable .
we do not therefore share the report &apos; s predilection for legislation at EU level .
there are a number of areas in which we feel that too much detail is gone into .
I want to emphasise that , in the EU countries , we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy , and the decisions of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this .
the Commission &apos; s proposal strikes a good balance .
technological development and new methods of organisation call , of course , for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation .
open coordination of this kind is not necessarily devoid of obligation .
of course , it must be binding , but it must be constructed from the bottom up and not developed by us specifying a host of rules and quotas centrally .
specifically , open coordination must be open both in the choice of resources and in the way in which everyone concerned is involved .
it is therefore important that more public interest be created for open coordination and that the latter should be focused on to a greater degree , whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we are now addressing and to which open coordination can also be applied .
it should not be secretive .
the process should be much better known , and it is here that I think Parliament has something to offer .
it can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus .
Mr President , first of all , I should like , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , to thank Anne Van Lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in terms of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it .
the apparently technical term &apos; social agenda &apos; in fact covers the day-to-day realities experienced by our fellow citizens .
we must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious European &apos; social model &apos; .
we have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed , which are the groups most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens .
the issues to be discussed select themselves : we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the Lisbon Summit .
we must give the people of Europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe , in order to ensure that their fundamental rights , including social rights , are safeguarded .
the urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights : the right to an income , the right to a wage , the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union .
implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community , an action plan to create jobs in services , especially those related to the information society .
as far as that is concerned , the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new forms of working is essential .
it is also important to ensure quality in health , an improved social situation , and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity .
we support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs P√©ry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive .
the fundamental notion of the general interest ought , moreover , to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness .
these three examples intended to combat poverty , support the development of activities for job creation , social liaison and quality of life , and to improve employees &apos; rights , should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens , although these same citizens currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity .
a number of amendments betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their erasers out as soon as they see the word &apos; legislation &apos; .
are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directives to protect investment and liberalise general interest services , but not to define and regulate what has been described here as the labour market ?
such a rejection of legislation , moreover , leads to a plain rejection of negotiation . we even have one amendment that goes as far as proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreements between the two sides of industry .
it is in this area that we can , in our opinion , find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market .
Mr President , there really is a need for a social agenda in Europe after many years of neo-liberal economic policy which has lead to unemployment and social exclusion everywhere , including in my own affluent country , Sweden .
begging has returned to our large towns after having disappeared from them as long ago as the immediate post-war years .
even the private charitable organisations and their soup kitchens appear to be needed again .
I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission &apos; s work and of Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report .
many of her proposals are extremely commendable and deserve our full support .
genuine social initiatives cost a lot of money , a factor which I think is discussed far too little in the report .
these resources must come mainly from the Member States . it is therefore the social authorities in each country upon whom demands must essentially be made .
governments must set aside more resources , more social workers must be appointed and more resources must be given to the voluntary social organisations . otherwise , the result will be fine words without any practical content .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report presents the Commission and its legislation as the real engine of social work .
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level .
the Commission can obviously make an important contribution , but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned .
the Commission can help set a high standard , but it is social workers , the unions and voluntary activists we must pin our hopes on , and not officials in Brussels .
finally , I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments .
on the contrary , I am very critical of the amendment .
the name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name .
the Secretariat must have made a mistake , and I would ask for this to be corrected .
Mr President , I welcome the publication this year of the new European Union social policy agenda for the years 2000-2005 .
this received fresh impetus at the Lisbon European Council meeting of the European Union leaders earlier this year .
key priorities in this agenda include the following : an increased role will be given to the social partners in terms of drafting EU directives and regulations .
employee relations will be improved .
there will be continued European Union support for local job creation programmes .
new EU mechanisms for mediation , arbitration and conciliation will be drafted .
a new EU charter for small businesses will be put in place .
there will be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society .
and there will be a modernising of telecommunications services and Internet-related activities .
from an Irish perspective I would like to say to the Members of the House that one of the reasons why there has been such strong economic progress in our country is the fact that we have had a system of social partnership in place since 1987 .
this has meant that the government has worked closely with the trade unions and employee groups on a whole range of economic and social activities in an effort to secure broad agreement in matters such as pay and conditions for employees in Ireland .
this has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad .
I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications services .
the European Union must take advantage of the new and evolving technologies which are coming on stream at this time .
I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunications regulations and directives which was published in July of this year by the Commission .
Parliament is presently deliberating on seven different telecommunications regulations and is due to give an opinion on these matters before Christmas .
as regards e-commerce , it is fair to say that the United States of America had a head start on the European Union .
however , the European Union is catching up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunications directives and regulations would certainly assist in this process .
finally , I would like to commend the Commissioner for consumer protection , Mr Byrne , for his efforts in trying to secure an agreement on how best to move forward on regulating a vast structure for e-commerce transactions now and for the future .
Mr President , for almost half a century European integration has been based on the economy .
indeed we spoke of a European Economic Community .
the priority was given to setting up a common market , with the principle of the free movement of property , goods and capital , the establishment of rules governing competition between firms and state aid .
social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies .
the provisions enshrined in the Treaty of Rome were confined to the principle of equal pay for men and women ( Article 141 ) and the freedom of movement of workers .
the Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report is an ambitious one . the rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda , chiefly in the following areas : employment , with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion , as concerns lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation .
next , in the area of social dialogue , this intensification would be expressed by adopting a directive on employee information and consultation , and the European Works Council Directive , with a revision of the directives on redundancies .
finally , in the area of social protection , it would take the form of pursuing a strategy of convergence .
it is a veritable catalogue of measures which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term .
in conclusion , the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one .
it demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive .
the method used , on the other hand , seems more debatable .
regarding the financing of NGOs and their participation in Community policies , there is still no legal basis in the Treaty , paragraph 13 .
similarly , with the new social agenda , there is a desire to pass legislation at Community level , at the risk of harmonising to minimum standards and short-circuiting social relations within the Member States .
before we continue with the agenda , there is something I would like to say .
due to the fact that we have wasted another 40 minutes today on a debate about the Rules of Procedure , we are now hopelessly behind schedule .
I must therefore ask you to stick religiously to your speaking time , so as to ensure that the sitting now proceeds in an orderly manner .
can you please discuss within your respective groups whether it is constructive to have forty minutes of moaning and groaning at the beginning of every sitting , before getting down to business .
the only people that suffer are you , who want to engage in political debate .
Mr President , if the rapporteur will allow me I will start by saying where I agree with her and - if the rapporteur will forgive me - that may not take long .
of course , colleagues and I share her ideals for a better standard of living for all the peoples of Europe , for a better quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion .
where I part company is on her proposals or - as Stephen Hughes said - her prescriptions to secure that end , because her proposals will lead us further away from those ideals rather than towards achievement .
various speakers have talked about the Lisbon Summit today . that was hailed six months ago as a very important summit .
mention was made there of a new direction for Europe : moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise , innovation , competition and employment .
however , the report says something slightly different : whereas Lisbon calls for a reform of the social model , it calls for reinforcement ; whereas Lisbon calls for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility , the report proposes four new or amended directives and a number of legislative initiatives .
the report sets out the standard Socialist solution throughout the ages of legislation , legislation , legislation .
what we need to pursue our common goals is not more regulation , but less .
we do not want more burdening of business , we want less .
we do not want more unemployment , we want less .
the original Commission proposal was much better left unamended - congratulations Commissioner .
I propose that we leave it unamended and we reject the report , otherwise we will give the clearest possible signal that Parliament is continuing to pursue the old agenda .
surely it is time to move on .
Mr President , the Commission has tabled a very ambitious proposal , and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for combining great understanding of national differences with considerable determination , without which this would never have been anything other than a pretty piece of paper .
I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter , something we could not have done without .
the debate today and in the Committee shows that there are major political differences and major differences in ambition in this area , and I think it good that these differences should be clearly brought out .
in this way , people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election : a choice between those who want to see a social Europe and those who merely want the EU to regulate the internal market . a choice between right and left .
our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and , in particular , from the British Conservative Party , have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme .
every time legislation is proposed , these Thatcher-inspired neo-liberals embark upon an ideological crusade .
Europe does not deserve dogmatism , however .
what Europe needs is for us to assess pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation .
in some cases , we need the open coordination method .
on other occasions , it is better for the two sides of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement .
we must not , however , be afraid to use legislation if this is what is required for us to achieve our objectives .
I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy has focused upon .
this is the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give us the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area .
within the area of the working environment , too , we must make a practical assessment of which tools are best for solving the various problems .
here , too , dogmatism is not the way forward but , rather , finding pragmatic solutions to real problems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that the Lisbon Summit has presented us with a picture of a future Europe which cannot , which must not be purely an economic Europe , but which must be a genuine political entity .
and in order to be a political entity , Europe must have a cultural and social , as well as economic structure .
in my opinion , therefore , the proposal presented by the Commission on the social agenda is extremely positive .
however , I do agree with almost all of Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report - and for this I am grateful to her - for I do not believe that when Mrs Van Lancker makes a specific reference to clear objectives , proposals for specific instruments and , in particular , precise deadlines , that she is reverting to the socialist logic of old , as somebody has suggested today .
it is rather that she is simply reverting to a longstanding need , the need for cohesion in a situation which , from this point of view , is becoming increasingly difficult to regulate because it lacks any form of harmonisation .
in discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues : we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken , even if this means producing more accurate legislation .
I do not believe that Mrs Van Lancker intends to create laws to regulate absolutely everything ; I feel rather that she considers it necessary , when coordinating actions do not produce the desired results , when the citizens encounter inequalities between the States and when there is no social harmonisation , to bring about this harmonisation .
the issue of open coordination must therefore be tackled alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal bases , for without them we will not be able to persuade the States to harmonise a social policy which upholds equality and equal opportunities .
Mr President , now that we have had a return to growth , it is crucial for the European Union to provide itself with the means to meet expectations in the social sector .
the Commission communication highlights a raft of ambitious objectives , such as full employment , equal opportunities , training , etc . , but there are many contradictions between the European Union &apos; s declared ambitions and its political decisions .
among other aspects , let me cite the concern for productivity , which generally involves wage moderation as a priority .
I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report , which opens up new perspectives , with an approach which aims for greater precision and greater coherence .
her report appreciably builds on the Commission &apos; s proposals by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulations and the coordination of national social legislation .
it calls for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiatives on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement , the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law .
this is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action .
this , I feel , is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking .
I am pleased to see , furthermore , that Mrs Van Lancker has included a number of amendments tabled by my Group , particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation .
together with my Group , I have tabled some amendments criticising the Commission &apos; s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint .
I advocate the reduction of working times without a concomitant reduction in salaries .
having said that , I support Anne Van Lancker &apos; s report , which has the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objectives which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , who has supplemented the Commission &apos;s already excellent report with amendments tabled by myself .
naturally , I am very pleased about this : it is just a pity that the amendments which are most important in my opinion have not been included .
I listened with pleasure to Mrs P√©ry &apos; s brief summary of the Council &apos; s social policy , which I firmly support .
I am very familiar with the project and support all the work carried out by Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou to date . she will remember that I asked her , one day , whether her attitude to Pensioners &apos; issues was that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations , one being Anna Lancker , for her outstanding report , and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou , for her outstanding submission .
it is an ambitious agenda , and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection .
the Council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time .
what is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy , based on the Lisbon decisions , indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature .
we do not want over-regulation - and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before - but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection , and not the rules of the nineteenth century .
we also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from developing the social economy and the services sector .
what is not so new , and the subject of repeated demands , is lifelong learning - which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about - as are the long overdue reforms to the European factory committee law , the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers , and freedom of movement .
I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work , employee participation and labour relations .
of course , I was delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issues of childcare , family and women &apos; s policy .
perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three people responsible - in the Commission , Parliament and the Council - are women .
but what we need now , in tandem with this , are instruments that allow for the involvement of fathers .
that would be a new departure .
besides , this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries , and I therefore wish it every success .
the Council must not leave various specific proposals that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air .
as the rapporteur , Mrs Van Lancker , emphasises , although social dialogue is important , it must produce tangible results .
otherwise , the Commission will have to propose legislative instruments and the Council will have to approve the measures needed , specifically by amending macroeconomic policies and the Stability Pact , in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our efforts to defend good quality jobs with respectable salaries and to advocate reforms that give employees dignity .
Mr President , I think that the social policy agenda is positive for everyone .
I think that harmonising the social policies of the different Member States cannot do anything other than benefit all Europeans . it will be particularly beneficial in all aspects relating to employment , which , since the Lisbon Summit , we know is a priority for the whole of the European Union .
I would like to particularly stress the benefit which , in terms of employment , can be obtained by women through giving them improved access to employment with guarantees in terms of working time and salary .
I think that there is also a great advantage , if we succeed in getting the directive applied , modified and updated , with regard to maternity leave : for women to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when women have to continue working during that period .
I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life .
it is going to enable women to continue in their jobs without neglecting their family obligations .
neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative means for new jobs , new technologies and the information society , where I think women have an important role to play .
these are new jobs where people can work from home with regulations that help to reconcile working life with family life .
all these coordinated social policy actions will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion .
I think that we should all welcome the arrival of this social policy agenda .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the Commissioner and Mrs P√©ry on this presentation of the social agenda .
I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments , sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive , dynamic interaction between economic , social and employment policies .
these instruments are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality .
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker &apos;s report and I would like , in particular , to stress a point which has , moreover , already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs P√©ry in their speeches , and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level , and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension .
this is what happens in many countries .
in conclusion , I would like to give an example : last week , the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a Minister - a woman , like the three representatives of the three institutions . this is tantamount to a revolution , for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years .
Mr President , the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concepts such as full employment , quality of work , social quality and modernisation of social protection .
but it lacks substance to some extent .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content .
we support a pact for employment and social cohesion , a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives , social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment , the minimum wage , and guaranteed income .
the European Union has already stood idly by for far too long , watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States .
indeed Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s proposals for improving the information available to , and participation of , female employees , and for social clauses in public contracts , mergers and international agreements , are long overdue .
we object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda .
social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis .
it sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection .
extending people &apos; s working lives is not modernisation , no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level , and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets .
we need modern , European social harmonisation , not deregulation .
Mr President , I have one minute and three points to make . firstly , I should like to thank Mrs van Lancker on the work she has done in producing this excellent report .
as for my second point , I wish to restate my Group &apos; s fundamental convictions .
the working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : the policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated , and also supported by legislative measures , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods .
as for my third point , there are some rights that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social Europe : the right to a minimum income , the information and consultation of employees , the European collective agreement .
these are points which , we know , are contested by the conservatives in Europe , but to which we , in our Group , attach great importance .
Minister , Commissioner , we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues .
I hope , Minister , that in nice the French Presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda , since embarking on the construction of a social Europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens .
Mr President , I should like to extend my special thanks both to the rapporteur , Mrs Van Lancker , and the French Presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed to date .
I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspects of the four areas touched on in greater or lesser detail by all the speakers , i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda , secondly the content , thirdly the means and fourthly the procedures .
as far as the political approach is concerned , we need , I think , to highlight two new elements .
the first is that , since Lisbon , the new approach to social policy is to deal with it not as a product or by-product of economic policy , but as a policy in its own right which needs to be exercised in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy .
in other words , this is the only way for us to deal with Europe &apos; s objectives of competitiveness , given our constant concern for enterprises and the economy , and social cohesion , given our constant concern for our citizens and their welfare .
the second element in the new approach is quality . quality as a new political concept to deal with working conditions , employment relations and the services of the social state .
these two political approaches underpin the entire content .
what are the basic strands which make up the content ?
there are three .
a set of projects and proposals on employment .
the second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy .
here I would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion , the new work which we have started on pensions and social protection , policies for people with special needs and , more importantly , I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect , i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy .
we must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy .
I think that this analysis will give us new , interesting results and approaches .
the third strand in the content is enlargement .
to be brief , social policy , the new social standards and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate countries with the Member States are one of the most important features of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that .
this brings me to the third area which has engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation : the means .
I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation , i.e. do we or do we not need legislation , is old hat .
clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in Europe , but changes on the job market , changes in the economy , changes in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements .
when we need to deal with these new requirements with legislation , we shall not , of course , have any hesitation in doing so .
if we can deal with them in other ways and with other methods , we shall do so .
the proposal for a scoreboard , for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda , is a huge challenge .
the problem is that , because of the legal basis which it has in the Treaty , the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws , a set of directives with specific steps for the Member States .
it is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies .
we therefore believe that , in the first instance , common European indicators , a project which is now nearing completion , and national objectives , i.e. the need for each country to have its own scoreboard and carry out monitoring , are a step along the road to providing us with specific results .
and one last comment : the question of sexual equality runs right through the social agenda as regards both the political approach and the content and means .
thank you , Commissioner , for your interesting speech .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m .
Community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001-2005 )
the next item is the report ( A5-0294 / 2000 ) tabled by Mrs Eriksson , on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001-2005 ) &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 335 - C5-0386 / 2000 - 2000 / 0143 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see you all here .
the Commission &apos; s communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States , the EEA States and the candidate countries , as well as a key part of external relations and development cooperation in the Union .
it also affirms that real democracy requires all citizens , women and men alike , to participate and be represented equally in the economy , decision making and social , cultural and civil life .
there are major deficiencies in all these areas . the Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures .
in tandem with integrating equality perspectives into all policy areas - what is normally called gender mainstreaming - specific measures for women will be implemented .
I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it is not an exaggeration to say that no efforts to promote gender equality are of lasting value unless women &apos; s rights are strengthened at the same time .
this work has gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning .
the Committee has submitted 49 amendments .
at the beginning we had 126 , which indicates that we are incredibly committed .
I am very pleased about this .
we believe , for example , that it is very important for the Commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested parties can keep abreast of proceedings throughout the implementation phase .
it is also incredibly important , not to say fundamental , that the various Community actions , the framework strategy and the Member States &apos; measures complement , and do not counteract , each other .
this is , of course , also the Commission &apos; s and the Council &apos; s express ambition .
the Commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance .
I have no objections in this respect , nor has the Committee .
we have come up with a new shock proposal , which is really a reiteration of what was stated in our opinion on the budget .
we believe that 40 per cent of the Structural Funds should be earmarked to focus on women &apos; s conditions and needs .
the Commission &apos; s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions , an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours .
what we have just recently discussed here in this Chamber are , of course , the social issues , and I wish once again to emphasise the repeated observation that over 50 million EU citizens are , in fact , classified as poor and that a large majority of those are women .
this is , of course , something which needs not only to be observed but also to be combated , and with the help of vigorous measures .
we have had a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedures .
I shall not go into any more detail here . rather , I just wanted to mention it .
we have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations .
discussions have been held as to how the candidate countries can be incorporated in the programme in a natural way .
we have also discussed what we must do in order not only to give a mention to women in the developing countries but also to be able to do something practical in this area .
during the final phase of the journey , I have been in very close contact with people in both the Commission and the Council .
we naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision , too .
what we mean in the Committee by strategy is , of course , not the Commission &apos; s opening gambit , but that strategy beginning as from paragraph 2 ( &apos; The Strategy &apos; ) .
I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedures cause this to be misunderstood , for no less than seven different amendments in the same spirit have been tabled .
in other words , the Council too must adopt the Commission &apos; s strategy .
it is therefore important that non-governmental organisations should obtain influence in the course of implementation .
one amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament , together with the Commission .
this perhaps affects only the Commission and Parliament , but I am very grateful indeed for the fact that you , Mrs Diamantopoulou and you , Mrs P√©ry are here , and I am very much looking forward to hearing your points of view on all the amendments .
Commissioner , we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission &apos; s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years .
unfortunately , the time available to us in committee did not give us a chance to process either the communication or Mrs Eriksson &apos; s report although , having said that , we did make every possible effort to respond to the objectives set by the European Commission .
at the same time , we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life , equal participation and representation , social rights , the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes .
women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme .
we think it is extremely important to promote a positive image of women and visibility of their work and importance .
we think that these projects will help women gain self-confidence in their role .
finally , we trust , as was said during the previous plenary when we debated older parliamentary reports , that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have had the fourth framework programme , and today we are discussing the fifth .
the present reports by the Commission and Parliament show that despite the fact that there have been a number of successes over the past few years , the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory points is too long .
therefore it is still our goal for the next five years to consolidate the position of women in the policies of all Member States , both in terms of quality and content .
as far as the strategic goals are concerned , for example , in the sphere of &apos; women in working life &apos; , economic and employment policy issues cannot be dealt with separately from issues of social responsibility , social security , and a fair distribution of caring responsibilities .
problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end .
furthermore , the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives , including , where necessary , implementing legislation and equal opportunities , and fighting discrimination .
the European Parliament , the national parliaments and networks must therefore become more closely involved .
financial resources are indispensable , as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do .
this programme is therefore conditional on funds totalling EUR 50 million being made available for the period from 2001 to 2005 .
this means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women &apos; s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide , and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively .
we must invest our energies in the realisation and implementation of the planned programmes , and this must go hand in hand with well-timed evaluations and coordination with other programmes .
we expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission , within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament .
it is also necessary to establish a Council of Ministers both in order to deal with the content of the work , and with a view to winning recognition for women &apos; s policy .
making women &apos; s policy an adjunct to other political themes does not do the matter justice .
women &apos; s policy must also be a criteria used to assess whether the candidate countries are ready for accession .
the European Parliament could lead the way here by setting a better example .
I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be as comprehensive as the present one .
for this to be the case , women &apos; s policy will have to be taken more seriously over the next five years and not just included in all political , economic and social programmes , but actually implemented .
women &apos; s policy is not - as happens so often - to be incorporated into programmes for minorities .
at 52 % , women are not a minority group !
I would like to congratulate Mrs Eriksson on an excellent report and the Commission on an excellent strategy for gender equality .
it encompasses all those areas where action is needed and , if successfully coordinated , could make a real difference to women in all aspects of their everyday lives .
this could work if the framework strategy were an integral part of the programme , as an annex to it .
this would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comments made by the rapporteur earlier on .
there has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed .
this time the Commission is putting forward a new approach .
it is very welcome but it is only valuable if it can actually be made to work .
that means also reaching women in their own communities .
the involvement of local and regional authorities in this process is invaluable .
they are the largest employers across the Member States and the central providers of education , training and economic development and , as such , they are key players in achieving equality .
I hope due regard will be paid to them in the final programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women .
for too long , women &apos; s role has been despised .
in this respect , the Napoleonic Code , which was framed in France at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of Europe , must shoulder a large share of the blame .
women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation , and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson &apos; s report makes any contribution towards this .
all the same , the texts before us are not entirely lacking in quality .
so , Amendment No 2 , presented by my own committee , grants single fathers the same rights as single mothers . equality and fair treatment must work both ways , that is the ideal .
I am delighted , moreover , that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life .
this report does , however , give some cause for concern .
amendment No 18 , for example , which seeks to support action by candidate countries to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choices alien to their culture .
in this respect , in New York , very distinct differences between the European Union and Poland emerged .
by failing to respect Poland &apos; s social choices , the European Union would be taking a very peculiar , and very disturbing , view of pluralism .
furthermore , Amendment No 19 on establishing an audit of equal opportunities within the public budget is extremely debatable .
indeed , the way the concept of discrimination has been manipulated makes it , in many respects , an empty formula used by a whole collection of sorcerer &apos; s apprentices in order to achieve their ideological ends .
it is high time we broke with an ideological vision of woman &apos; s place in society .
in this area , as in many others , it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates .
it is not right for a handful of women , expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies , to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women .
in this respect , I cannot but endorse the decision by the Committee on Budgets to break the monopoly held for so long by the European Women &apos; s lobby .
I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course .
a decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliances which too closely bind a number of pressure groups to the European Commission and to some political groups in this House .
the women &apos; s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision .
I could go even further , and say it would be ennobled by such a decision .
this is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote .
( applause from the UEN Group )
Mr President , we are aware of the progress that has been made in recent years with regard to the situation of women , particularly the legislative progress , but there are still situations of real inequality in everyday life .
the low level of representation of women in political and economic spheres and gender-related violence are two clear signs that structural discrimination against women is continuing .
this programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns , needs and aspirations of women are taken into account in all policies .
the current situation requires that positive action measures in favour of women be implemented .
the objectives that the programme sets out in five specific areas will help to ensure that all the action taken will be associated with at least one of those areas .
participation in economic life , which women should enjoy under equal conditions to men , employment , which is the basis for all equality and integration , and achieving the 60 % target proposed at the Lisbon Summit , would also solve other problems .
the inclusion of this objective in all Community programmes , within the framework of the Structural Funds , should be effected in accordance with Community legislation .
equality in participation and representation , balance in the decision-making process , greater participation in political life , whatever the process adopted , in order to achieve an increase in the participation of women , until we reach the 40 % figure proposed by the Commission .
EQUAL access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men , which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave , maternity protection , working time , employment contracts , etc .
equality between women and men in civil life , allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms .
we especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in women and domestic violence .
we need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender , which will also help to solve some of the other problems above .
in relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaigns and a European equality week in cooperation with the Member States , as the Commission proposes .
we think that it is very useful to create a web site , not only due to the increasing use of computerised media , but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded .
something that we think is of particular importance is the evaluation of the programme ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou &apos; s second tour de force .
with the framework strategy and the new action programme in place , the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities - working under intense time pressure , and restricted to only a few official languages - has now , with a great deal of good will , introduced 60 proposed amendments .
I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council , Nicole P√©ry , will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November .
I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme , when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget , no less .
time is pressing .
women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes .
according to Eurostat , approximately 77 % of the recipients of low wages are women .
depending on the country and sector , women earn up to 30 % less than their male counterparts .
the framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard as well .
all the equal opportunities initiatives should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five , specific , strategic goals .
other speakers have made the same point .
that would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept .
I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes .
we also want to see the leading politicians on our side , and call upon President Prodi , the Council , and the Ministers , to take full account of the gender aspect , for example in the context of the European Union &apos; s foreign relations , and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned .
more emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women &apos; s organisations , which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme .
our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area , together with the parliamentary committees of our Member States and of the candidate countries , in November in Berlin .
I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy .
this is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women &apos; s rights in Europe .
Mr President , following the first four action programmes for equality between women and men , it was a good move on the part of the Commission to innovate by proposing a Community framework strategy for equality and a programme to implement this strategy and make real progress towards equality .
there is great need of this , even though a quarter of a century has passed since the first Community directive on the equal treatment of men and women with regard to pay .
I find the Commission &apos; s new approach to be a very positive one , and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered .
unfortunately , the report by the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities is no improvement on the text put forward by the Commission .
it overeggs the pudding , and includes unconsidered and indigestible proposals , worded in such a way as to make a first-year law student &apos; s hair stand on end .
in committee , I had tabled a raft of amendments intended to do away with the worst of the incongruities , particularly those that demonstrated an outlandish mish-mash of strategy and programmes .
the Commission has produced an excellent text .
it is a very serious mistake , in politics , to mix strategy up with tactics or with programmes .
as is so often the case in reports by the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , we have here a report including the ideological claims of the left wing coalition , the gauche plurielle , in this Parliament , like the claim that measures eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of , I quote , &quot; the significance of a general reduction in working hours &quot; .
do we really need to waste any of the paltry EUR 53.45 million in appropriations to cover five years on such an analysis ?
I think not .
I am also of the opinion that the appropriations for the European Women &apos; s lobby , budget line A 3037 , should not be included in the appropriations committed for the programme and I hope that the Commissioner will favour the amendments that I and the other members of my Group have tabled , above the rapporteur &apos; s own far-fetched amendments .
Mr President , I think it would be a great shame if Nicole P√©ry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here , so that we might hear her points of view , too .
Mrs Eriksson , Mrs P√©ry has not asked to speak and I cannot force her to . I cannot order the President-in-Office of the Council to take the floor .
in any case , I feel that we should thank her for following the debate , especially since she was not scheduled to be present during this discussion as well .
however , I see that she is preparing to leave now .
Mr President , I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson , who has endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for us to accept the programme as quickly as possible , so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programmes and can start implementing the fifth programme in January .
this programme is an important document for the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights , which is why it provoked a great deal of interest and , of course , it forms part of the more overall strategy which was discussed with the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights , the Committee on Social Affairs and the Council .
it is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life , at the decision-making centres , in social policy , in civil society and in human rights , together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education .
our cooperation with the committee was excellent , which is why we can accept a large number of amendments , either to the letter or in spirit .
specifically , we accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 28 , 32 , 43 , 46 , 48 , 49 , 51 , 55 , 56 and 59 .
we are also able to accept parts of Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 37 , 45 , 50 , 53 , 57 and 58 .
I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights .
I should like to make two comments on the amendments which we are unable to accept , mainly for technical and legal reasons rather than because of a difference of approach .
first , as far as the strategy is concerned .
it is not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the Council decision , but I agree that some amendments could be made to the wording of the articles in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy has been taken into account and forms the basis on which the programme will be implemented .
secondly , as far as the specific percentage to be earmarked from the Structural Funds is concerned .
I should remind you that a regulation was voted through last year which clearly sets out how items are allocated and we cannot use a programme to change the regulation which already exists .
I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current actions and programmes and , of course , on the important role which non-governmental organisations must play in designing and implementing these programmes .
major European women &apos; s organisations therefore clearly have access to all the programmes .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the two reports tabled on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and industrial Policy :
( A5-0290 / 2000 ) tabled by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen , on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 &#91; SEC ( 2000 ) 720 - C5-0302 / 2000 - 2000 / 2153 ( COS ) &#93; ;
( A5-0281 / 2000 ) tabled by Mr Evans , on the Commission &apos;s eighth survey on State aid in the European Union &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 205 - C5-0430 / 2000 - 2000 / 2211 ( COS ) &#93; .
Mr President , I very much welcome the Commission &apos; s report .
it is a splendid piece of work that Commissioner Monti and his staff carried out last year .
in my report on the twenty-ninth report on the Commission &apos; s competition policy , I expended particular energy on the problems concerning mergers and the repayment of State aid .
I did this for a number of reasons .
firstly because , in the course of last year , I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers , especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission &apos; s ruling .
with regard to State aid , moreover , problems apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid State aid is paid back to the national exchequers .
let us begin , however , with mergers . one consequence of EMU is , of course , that we see more and more mergers .
I also think the time is ripe for re-assessing whether the procedures and sets of rules we have at present are as good as they could be .
the world is not , of course , always so easy for those who have to follow the rules and procedures we are involved in devising .
I think it is necessary for clear rules to be devised for what is called the relevant market .
it is important to distinguish between what may be called the peripheral areas of Europe and what may be called the heart of Europe .
it is especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement , for it can be difficult for the smaller countries in the peripheral areas when companies wish to merge , because the latter quickly become large players in their own market .
it is not especially appropriate that larger companies in small countries should be prevented from merging for , in that way , their opportunities to compete globally are reduced .
I should therefore like to remind you that we do , of course , have existing rules to take care of those circumstances in which companies exploit their important and possibly dominant market positions .
we therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of mergers .
after all , it is not a crime for companies to merge .
another thing I feel very strongly about is the need to arrange for mergers to go through more quickly .
I am thinking here , in particular , of those circumstances in which a company wishes to appeal against the Commission &apos; s ruling .
quite simply , a period of between 25 and 35 months is too long in our global village for getting a case through the courts , and what is very time consuming is having the documents of the case translated .
that is not good enough .
we owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and , especially , their future .
on the subject of mergers , I have two questions for you , Commissioner Monti .
would it be possible to consider different possible solutions for separating the Commission &apos; s functions of judge and prosecutor ?
for example , could there be a panel of independent experts during the second hearing so that it is not exclusively people from the Commission who assess individual merger cases ?
I also have another idea , even if it is perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority .
might not a committee of experts or an expert tribunal , specialising in companies , be set up in the department of first instance at the court in Luxembourg ?
in Denmark , for example , we have a special maritime and commercial court dealing exclusively with issues relating to companies .
I would also take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner to explain why one of the most trusted merger specialists has left the Commission .
the other subject I raised in my report is that of State aid and the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully .
I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully , especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement .
it is good that State aid to shipyards in Europe should be phased out as per 1 January 2001 , even if it is extremely problematic that our shipyards should continue to have to compete with the South Korean treasury .
in the light of the latest development , I can appreciate why the Commission has , with good reason , adopted a harder line on South Korea .
I am wondering , therefore , if you could report on the very latest developments , Commissioner , even though I am well aware that you only have limited time available .
I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public , efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and , in the same vein , when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality .
finally , I want to emphasise that , for me as a liberal , it is crucially important that companies can be sure of being dealt with properly and efficiently in all areas , so that there are no hitches where companies &apos; future legal certainty is concerned .
I should also like to thank my fellow MEPs in Committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperated in connection with my report .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen for her contribution and for her cooperation in relation to these two reports .
they have been taken in joint debate because common issues apply .
I endorse much of the agenda that has been set by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen .
I should like to begin somewhat unusually by congratulating the Commission on a document it published back in June 1999 - the Community rules on state aid , what I might call the &quot; idiot &apos;s guide &quot; to the operation of the state aid scheme .
it is helpful in that it sets out the Treaty provisions , the definitions of state aid and also the exemptions from the ban on state aid .
in the course of preparing my report , I have had to struggle with that particular conundrum .
there are those in this House who will wish to emphasise the exemptions ; however , I wish to make it clear that for the most part the operation of state aid works against free competition within a single market .
the single market is essential in terms of promoting the interests of consumers .
they must have a wide variety of high-quality , competitively priced goods and that , ultimately , is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and , along with it , free competition , because it is to the benefit of all our citizens .
turning now to the eighth survey : although there has been a reduction in the overall level of state aid during the period concerned , this can in fact be attributed to a minority of Member States and , taken overall , ten Member States have seen levels of state aid increase .
I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share .
I therefore welcome the indications we have received from the Commissioner that he anticipates that by July of next year we will be seeing progress in relation to the delivery of a state aid scoreboard and register .
that is important in terms of the need for transparency .
I would ask him how he sees the debate on enlargement in view of the fact that , on the one hand , we must ensure that we have a common regime across all states within the European Union and , on the other hand , it must be the case that some of the candidate countries have particular difficulties in adjusting to new open market conditions .
I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial services sector .
I should like to congratulate him on a speech he made in Barcelona in September - and I am very grateful to his staff for sending a copy of the speech to me - devoted as it was to his view on the synergy between state aid control and the financial services sector .
but in due course we must see rather more of that in the state aid report itself .
I also would wish to see changes in the way that the state aid report is put together in order to ensure it is able to take account of future developments .
for instance , during the period of time of this report , no state aid was given to the coal sector in the UK and yet we all know that significant aid is currently being proposed by the UK Government .
I take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner for some information regarding two cases within the United Kingdom where the Commission has currently instituted action - if indeed it is the case that action has been instituted .
there are the cases of the universal bank proposed by the UK Government to assist post offices in the UK and also the venture capital schemes in the regions of the United Kingdom .
I understand he has asked for information concerning this .
it is quite clear that throughout the report itself much attention has been directed not just to the past but also to Commissioner Monti &apos; s proposals for future reform of competition policy .
that is an issue which will be coming before Parliament in due course .
Commissioner Monti will be very well aware of the concerns that are shared by many people who support his proposals for reform but feel that there need to be answers in relation to issues like jurisdiction shopping , legal certainty , the role of national courts , dialogue between the national competition authorities and the Commission itself , as also issues of staffing within the Commission .
those are matters that we will consider in debates in due course and for which - I am delighted to inform the Commission - I have been appointed Parliament &apos; s rapporteur .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of the lavish amount of speaking time we permit ourselves for debates of this kind , I want to dispense with the preliminaries and address Commissioner Monti directly .
Commissioner , you know that for some time now , there has been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues . this means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy .
with the passage of time though , I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not , in fact , gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned , or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition .
I will cite one of several examples , and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own .
it concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry .
I will take the precaution , Commissioner - in case you should want to point out that this in fact falls within Commissioner Palacio &apos; s remit - of saying that I am addressing the Commission as a whole .
I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today .
I expect the Commission to uphold its agreements .
I do not expect it to abuse judgements from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements .
I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind : competition is not an end in itself .
when a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy , account must be taken of the social , structural and industrial implications , and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology .
if the aspects I mentioned are taken into consideration , and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology , then the subsidy licences that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay .
this does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy ; it applies right across the board .
competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all .
to sum up , what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good .
this must be the guiding principle in all areas .
Commissioner , I want to take up what I said at the beginning .
the support is still there .
but if you carry on in this vein , you risk losing the support of not insignificant sections of the House .
I dare say that is unlikely to help matters overall .
Mr President , I am going to talk about Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen &apos; s report .
I want to begin by congratulating her on a very good report .
one of the absolutely basic principles of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies , products , countries and regions should work well and be fair and correct , as well as be for the benefit of consumers .
allow me to begin with something said by Adam Smith , the Father of economic liberalism , in 1776 , to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversations &apos; ending with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raising prices .
certainly , a good deal has happened in the last 200 years or so , but we have the same aspirations today .
if the internal market is to operate , we must have active institutions which look after issues of competition .
Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect .
paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen &apos; s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned , together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts .
this applies particularly in view of the fact that , in dealing with mergers , the Commission has something of a double role .
the Commission both supervises and applies the rules of competition .
this double role makes special demands in terms of openness , control and predictability .
the second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18 .
it is of general relevance , but its point of departure is the planned merger between motor manufacturers Volvo and Scania .
as is well known , the Commission opposed this merger , which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed .
a clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area .
as long as the internal market is not complete , it is mainly large companies in small Member States which can lose out in competitiveness to companies elsewhere in the world .
how are large companies with large home markets to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the EU &apos; s rules make this impossible ?
coming as I do from a small country , I myself am very pleased , therefore , that the Committee should have adopted the amendments I proposed in this connection .
I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rules of competition on the basis of these assumptions .
Commissioner Monti , on behalf of the Italian Radicals , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced , which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition .
I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general points regarding European competition policies and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets , not in order to deny any progress made thusfar , but with a view to the future .
in my opinion , a particularly regrettable factor , if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop , is still the presence of large numbers of powerful public companies in sectors which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process .
I could mention , for example ... let me see ... the State monopoly of retirement pensions , but I will restrict myself , more pertinently , to firms operating in the sectors of general interest services .
it is my view that , in these sectors , competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the State is both regulator and operator .
I know , Commissioner , because I have had occasion to read and hear your views on the matter , that your response to the objections is that the articles of the Treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms .
however , we cannot be satisfied with this response if we want Europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and - dare I say it - if we study carefully certain situations which are developing , in which even the current rules would allow us to intervene .
the whole of Europe is experiencing the growth of an aggressive State capitalism which has resulted in a series of private companies being taken over by State monopolies or former monopolies , in any case by companies which are firmly in public hands , companies which are State-owned .
we have heard the justification many times ; it is always ready to be trotted out - we must ensure that our companies and their assets retain their value through the privatisation process - meanwhile privatisation generally becomes more and more delayed instead of facilitated .
and , naturally , these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive .
in all cases , these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise .
in many cases , they are companies which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserves .
truly , Commissioner , can we not perceive in these cases the existence of State aid , concealed to a greater or lesser extent , or abuse of a dominating position ?
or again , the transfer at the very least of the distorting effects of the dominating position from one sector to another ?
or , lastly , the ever increasing consolidation of the positions of the incumbents which will make it difficult for newcomers to enter the various markets after liberalisation ?
by way of example , Deutsche Post has recently gained control of DHL International and is operating under a monopoly for dispatches up to 200 grams , and then , on a more general note , we could cite the diversification of the State postal companies in other sectors ;
EDF ( El√©ctricit√© de France ) has taken over companies in Britain , Sweden and Finland , France Telecom has taken over Orange ; on the Italian side of things , Enel has taken over Infostrada and , still in the Italian context , we could mention the various companies owned by local authorities which are behaving in a similar fashion .
lastly , Commissioner , there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service , which is a concept that is fading fast .
of course , there is the Treaty of Amsterdam , but I wonder whether the constraints imposed by the governments on the excellent work of your predecessor should , in any case , be justified as a way of exempting these companies from European competition rules .
Mr President , we welcome the modernisation of the competition policy which , in terms of set-up , has undergone little change since the sixties .
this overhaul is all the more imperative since nearly all of the Member States have now established a sound , independent competition authority .
I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy .
if we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in Brussels , then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation .
I am delighted about the special attention being paid to the position of large undertakings in small Member States in paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution .
these are the ones experiencing major adverse effects from infringements of the internal market or from the continued existence of borders within the internal market , because their &apos; home market &apos; cannot sufficiently absorb these blows .
what are the Commissioner &apos; s objections to lending the concept of &apos; relevant market &apos; a predominantly EU-wide dimension in the event of mergers ?
I would also like to draw the Commissioner &apos; s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination projects .
naturally , we endorse the polluter pays principle . but this principle certainly cannot always be applied , especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination projects , because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century .
given the staff shortages in your Directorate-General , Mr Monti , it is not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this .
it seems to me that the effect of these projects on the competitive sphere is rather minor .
finally , the book by your predecessor , and former Commissioner , Mr Van Miert , entitled &quot; Mijn jaren in Europa &quot; &#91; My years in Europe &#93; gives some idea of the blackmail-like tactics which a Competition Commissioner comes up against .
it speaks volumes .
I hope you are affected by this to a lesser extent , but I fear the worst .
I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of years , and I look forward to reading similar memoirs by yourself in due course .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the reports we have heard about today , and which do not just record what happened in the past , but also pick out the central themes of the present debate , and even incorporate the Commission &apos; s plans .
competition is not , as has already been said , an end in itself .
it must serve the interests of consumers , companies and local conditions .
competition is therefore always a means to an end .
it is a vital cornerstone of our model , in terms of political order , of the socio-economic market economy .
I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything , which is why competition is not completely unrestricted , nor should it be .
we therefore need two things : firstly , in the interests of increased transparency , we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidies that influence competition , and secondly there must be areas of our day-to-day lives and behaviour which are not subject lock , stock and barrel to the dictates of European competition policy .
the sports sphere or the numerous non-governmental organisations in the social and health spheres , to quote two examples .
who , like us , says &apos; yes &apos; to a functioning internal market , must also have the courage of their convictions to say &apos; yes &apos; to European competition policy .
therefore , we welcome the modernisation of competition policy , which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals .
the Community &apos; s competition policy has been given a new European and international dimension .
in view of the enlargement process and globalisation , it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relations within and outside the European Union .
I therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the Community on the one hand , and the fact that European competition policy now extends beyond Union borders .
on a final note , we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because , increasingly , the market is not the national market .
we need to promote the citizens &apos; awareness of competition policy , so that they recognise the advantages .
we also need to step up debate in the European public arena on the relevant proposals , because they are frequently misunderstood .
what I mean - and this is directed at the public , not the Commission - is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation , but must instead lead to Europeanisation .
when you delegate responsibility , you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility !
lastly , boosting the citizens &apos; autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , European competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions .
we still have a lot to do on that score , Commissioner !
Mr President , today no one disputes , and of course I am not going to do so , the fact that state aid alters the conditions for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings .
this is certain , but if each and every one of us is honest , we have to admit that in our public life we have often defended state aid when an undertaking has required it in order to establish itself , for example , in our constituency , or in order to prevent it from closing .
I began by saying this in order to highlight what is associated with some positions and to point out that when we are trying to issue a European Parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid , the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party tries to conduct an ideological debate in this House on state aid in which it aims to go further than anyone and to demonise all types of aid .
this happened last year with the Jonckheer report , and this year , despite the more flexible position adopted by Mr Evans , it has continued to arise , perhaps in order to present the Socialists as some sort of outdated interventionists who use measures that are as damaging for the market as state aid .
I have already had the opportunity to express that state aid is a transfer of public money to private companies and , therefore , that as Socialists we should also be against it .
however , we cannot deny the obvious and we should recall that the Treaty does not forbid all types of aid , so some types that are aimed at objectives such as social cohesion , regional cohesion , the environment , etc. should be permitted . if that is the case , and it is , why does the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party refuse to accept amendments that cover that point ?
the same occurs when the report insists , following the Commission &apos; s line , that aid for coal did not serve to secure the future of the industry , but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence , also from the Commission , saying that this aid was necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector .
in this respect , it is difficult for us to agree with a report which , although it reflects part of the truth , refuses to include another part of the truth .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Evans and Mr Karas have highlighted the significance of state aids and competition policy very clearly in this debate .
in future we must remember that there are national aid schemes , in respect of internal competition , for example , which are especially important and valuable in countries with low population densities and where distances are long .
I wish to raise one issue in this regard , that of transport aid .
I am thinking here of my own country , for example , where the distances are long .
in the north the price of fuel is 0.2 euros higher than in southern Finland .
in addition , shipments of raw materials , animal feedingstuffs and similar goods are especially important as far as internal competition is concerned and issues of major importance in order that state aids may continue to support them .
they are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment , and I hope that in future this can be made clear , so that these aids , these internal aids , which affect regional development and the regional economy , in which transport aid is a key example , might continue .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , ladies and gentlemen , a European , open , competitive and coordinated market economy needs an effective competition policy .
without a properly administered competition policy , neither the European Union &apos; s economy nor its external manifestation , in the form of the euro , will ever be able to achieve its full potential .
only a company that is competitive in the Internal Market without State aid can also be competitive in the global market .
however , in shaping European competition policy we have to ensure that it does not limit the opportunities for companies to succeed in the wider , global economy as well .
besides , a dominant market position is not even a problem unless there is evidence that this position is being abused .
only if the dominant market position leads to adversity with regard to consumers and competitors must we tackle the situation using stringent measures , as you , Mr Monti , have done .
as Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen states in point 15 of her report , we have to focus on the harm caused as a result of measures restricting competition , and not so much on what sort of economic players are involved .
special account must be taken of the position of small and medium-sized enterprises .
small-scale State aid might be more harmful to an SME than people think if the market is a small one .
for that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen &apos; s also emphasises the importance of this .
in his report , my colleague , Mr Evans , thanks you , Mr Monti , for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy .
massive amounts of State aid are still a problem in many sectors .
although State aid may , on the surface , seem a good solution , when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produces lasting positive results .
I certainly do not want to condemn all State aid .
there is also aid that is necessary , as laid down the Treaties .
in the long run , however , levels of State aid will have to fall .
state aids lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change , to the distortion of competition , and breed inefficiency .
in a sense , State aids prop up Potemkin villages , which at some stage will come crashing down .
then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all let me express my deep disagreement with the excessively liberal , if not actually ultraliberal , tendencies of the report by our fellow Member , Mr Evans .
hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998 , even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction , is already bizarre , to say the least .
let me add that state aid must be supervised strictly according to the terms of the treaties and not in accordance with the prevailing liberal ideology .
between the omnipresent State , which no one wants any more , and the completely absent State , which is nothing more than a modern-day law of the jungle , this concept which many term the European social model forces us to continually seek a balance between those things that can be governed by the market and those which public authorities have a duty to regulate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are also to discuss the Montfort report this week , which Parliament wants to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking .
it is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three things in this debate .
firstly , the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted , Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom .
of course , this right demands strict competition law , because only this will guarantee fair competition .
it protects consumers and investors .
secondly , it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert , which tells us about the means employed by entrepreneurs to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs .
thirdly therefore , I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law , previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control , Professor Monti .
against this background , you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again .
this statement contains three important messages .
firstly , the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading .
secondly , the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities .
and thirdly - and this is highly relevant to this debate - there must of course be no areas which are exempt from competition law .
it is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble .
it must not annul the general validity of Community law .
hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact , including the need for transparency , are particularly valuable .
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
( ES ) Mr President , I would first like to apologise for having arrived late .
secondly , I would like to welcome the work done by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen , with whom I have had an excellent and constructive relationship .
and obviously , Mr President , although my opinion refers to the Commission &apos; s 29th report on competition policy , it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past , but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future .
it has been said - and I am only going to pick up on what has been said so far - that competition is presently the big word in our society , it is the great catalyst for the development of our society , particularly of our European society .
therefore , Mr President , we need to recognise that , with Member States that are ceasing to be producers and becoming regulators , the Commission policy needs to change , and in this sense , this report is part of that important development .
in its opinion , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did nothing more than highlight something which has been said and repeated : that we need clear rules , because this is the only way of knowing what the rules of play are .
we cannot leave everything to the market with no regulation at all .
what we need are clear rules and - I stress - rules that are of a sufficient level or category .
in any event , interpretations or interpretative communications are no good .
and also , of course , that the Commission &apos; s policy , which we welcome and support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , should not be shaped , in this process of decentralisation , to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses , to the detriment of the citizens .
I will end with a phrase from John Rawls , the philosopher of law : inequalities are always justified when they increase the level of the system and support the weakest without affecting fundamental rights .
Commissioner , knowing how far this goes in the universal service , in public service , is the great challenge for the Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament in general for the great interest that it has once again displayed in matters of competition .
Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy .
a big thank you to Mr Evans as well , for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union .
all three reports assume considerable importance in the light of the efforts the Commission has made to increase the transparency of its competition policy and to explain what it is doing to the citizens .
on the subject of explaining competition policy , I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition days , which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year .
the idea was conceived in this Parliament and developed by Parliament and the Commission .
my feeling is that , together , we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy .
I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what has been said and with very many of the points contained in the resolutions .
Mr President , in the time available to me , I would like to focus on the following three points : the modernisation of Community competition law , the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid .
on the subject of modernisation , I will attempt , within the constraints imposed , to respond to some of the extremely interesting points which have been raised .
the annual report on competition policy emphasises the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of Community competition law in the areas of both monopolies and State aid .
I will not go into the details of the reform projects which have recently been completed or are still being developed , for they have already been the subject of a specific consultation process between the Commission and Parliament , or will be in the future , in the constructive dialogue which is so valuable .
with regard to State aid , in my opinion , the entry into force , in 1999 , of the Rules of Procedure was a considerable step forward .
they increase transparency and establish the deadlines for adopting the decisions on State aid .
as far as monopolies are concerned , the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last .
a great many observations made by Parliament during consultation over the White Paper were taken into account even as early as at the stage of drawing up the proposal .
particular attention was paid to the concerns expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty .
I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio , Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration .
I am now waiting for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institutions on these legislative proposals and I am sure that it will be as constructive as the first stage .
as you know , on 9 and 10 November , the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg , a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper .
my second point is the application of the competition rules during 1999 .
in the year in question , there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions .
one of the things I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources .
the Commission has continued to intervene resolutely , particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned .
as in the debate on mergers , since time is limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific questions , I will not mention the major - albeit numerous - interventions we have made .
the third point is State aid .
I am happy to note the support which Parliament continues to lend us in relation to the eighth survey too .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s proposals on the future development of these information tools , which will include the register and the scoreboard as well as audits .
I confirm to Mr Evans and the other Members who have spoken on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial versions of the register and the scoreboard - Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen also upholds this idea - before June 2001 , and I am confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instruments governing State aid .
Mr President , I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific points raised .
several Members - Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen , Mr Schmidt , Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi - have posed the problem of large companies operating in relatively small countries .
could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there , when it comes to merger operations ?
well , if the relevant market , on the basis of the analysis conducted , happens to be national in scope , you must realise that doing what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumers and customers in those national markets .
what we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market .
otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way .
I add , in relation to the specific Volvo-Scania case that I am sure underlies many speakers &apos; remarks , that both companies have been able to reach solutions that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interests of competition and consumers in those markets .
should we introduce a panel of independent experts to assess mergers ?
the recourse to external expertise can be useful and already takes place in a number of cases .
but the Commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of taking decisions to an external body .
it belongs to us .
it may , on occasion , be uncomfortable , but this is our task .
concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned , I have already expressed my regret about that resignation .
further increasing the right of defence , the transparency of the procedures , including the enhanced position of the hearing officer , is something to which I am very much attached and upon which I am reflecting , taking into account several inputs including the useful ideas provided by that official before he resigned .
as far as Korea is concerned , Mr Lamy , who will be coming here during the course of the week , will be better placed to update you on the latest developments .
I can only , for my part , state my conviction that any extension of operating state aids to shipyards would not be the appropriate response to a situation that requires other types of intervention .
Mr Evans , I very much share your concern on the issue of state aids to financial services .
we will pursue that point with determination .
Mr Rapkay , it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away .
looking at the resolutions we are discussing today , I see the Commission &apos; s policy as very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolutions .
in the area notably of state aids , it must not be thought that the Commission believes in a pure or ultra-liberal policy .
state aids have their place but it is a fact that in many cases the concrete manifestation of state aids goes well beyond what the Treaty allows and what the guidelines allow .
but believe me , I certainly see competition policy as an instrument of a social market economy .
the stronger the implementation of competition the better the market tends to be .
there is full scope for social aspects provided they are not mixed up in a non-transparent way with the functioning of the market .
you mentioned Deutsche Post : for example , procedures are currently in progress at the Commission on Deutsche Post in respect of both these areas , and I can assure you that the Commission does not intend the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition preventing appropriate control of State aid on this matter as well .
in this regard , and as far as State aid is concerned , I refer you to the Communication adopted by the Commission on 20 September on services of general economic interest .
Mr President , I think I have exceeded the time allowed to me .
I apologise to those to whose questions I have not had time to respond .
I would , however , like to end by quoting the report of the Legal Affairs Committee .
it states , Mrs Palacio :
all too often Commission decisions in the field of competition are presented in the press as defeats for national interests rather than victories for the internal market and for the consumer . &apos;
our intention is to have more and more of these victories and to be more and more able to explain them to European consumers and to European citizens .
of course , Parliament has a very important role to play in this respect .
Mr President , I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner .
I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament , and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter .
I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group , and expressed a real concern of ours , and if you heard Mr Caudron speak , then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about , because it is also something that bothers another MEP .
and so I only spoke on behalf of my Group , and not for Parliament as a whole .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments
the next item is the report ( A5-0277 / 2000 ) by Mrs Sartori , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 628 - C5-0307 / 2000 - 2000 / 0807 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the Commission &apos;s report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
the financial assistance is currently governed by Council Regulation No 1969 of 1988 .
this mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation , currently Denmark , the United Kingdom and Sweden .
the regulation and the proposal for a regulation have merged two mechanisms ( medium-term financial assistance and the Community loan mechanism intended to provide medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments ) into a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance .
this proposal changes the mechanism &apos; s ceiling .
therefore , although the increase in convergence of States reduces the likelihood that the mechanism will be used , it must still have sufficient resources to meet the simultaneous needs of several countries , should this be necessary .
this is why we propose to reduce the amount available from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion .
this resolution also envisages the possibility of considering creating a special mechanism providing financial assistance to the balance of payments of the candidate countries .
clearly , this is a possibility for the future and therefore does not have a bearing on the present situation , but it is a possibility which I considered that we could at least examine in some depth so that we will be prepared should these issues arise .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Sartori for her report , which we have found very valuable .
the aim of this Commission report is to provide a basis for examining the single facility providing medium-term financial support and for revising it , should this prove necessary .
the financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty , which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union .
the last assessment was carried out in October 1997 on the basis of a report drawn up by the Commission .
on that occasion , the Council endorsed the Commission &apos; s position , which recommended that the mechanism should be continued , and decided that a further assessment , carried out according to the same procedure , would be necessary in the light of the changes linked to the commencement of the third stage .
the Commission is therefore bound to submit a report to the Council so that the Council can carry out this additional assessment of the mechanism .
the report makes three principle recommendations .
in view of the current level of economic , financial and monetary integration , the likelihood that these Member States will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view , but the mechanism must , nevertheless , remain in force .
secondly , the possibility of having recourse to funds contributed by other Member States to finance the loans granted under the mechanism should be eliminated since , for various reasons , it has never been used .
in future , recourse to the capital market should be the only option available .
thirdly and finally , the drop in the number of Member States who could now apply for this form of financial support and the need to cover the potential borrowing requirement of new Member States justify lowering the mechanism &apos;s ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion .
the Economic and Financial Committee has drawn up an opinion which it sent to the Presidency on 14 July 2000 .
the Committee considers that the conclusions of the analysis of the single facility performed by the Commission are in line with its positions .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
Vegetative propagation of the vine
the next item is the report ( A5-0195 / 2000 ) by Mrs Klass , on behalf of the Committee on Development and cooperation , on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68 / 193 / EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 59 - C5-0090 / 2000 - 200 / 0036 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful for the fact that we are , after all , to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68 / 193 / EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine , and I also hope that tomorrow &apos; s vote will have a positive outcome .
in terms of area , production and consumption European wine growing is in a leading position globally .
in several Member States wine growing represents a significant proportion of total agricultural production , and in many regions this sector is a crucial source of agricultural income .
wine growing frequently takes place in areas in which other forms of agricultural activity would be difficult or impossible .
wine growing is a very varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures .
the vine propagating material provides the basis for optimal grape and wine production as regards quality , excellence and quantity , and establishes these factors over a period of 25 to 40 years .
it is thus extremely significant and it is essential to guarantee optimum reliability in terms of quality and trueness to variety .
the trade in , and marketing of , material for vegetative propagation of vines has , up to now , been laid down in directive 68 / 193 / EEC dating from 1968 .
the directive contains a number of provisions which up to now have allowed Member States to make unilateral exemptions from some of the rules , and the directive has already been amended several times .
I welcome the Commission &apos; s proposal for amendments , which has grouped the amendments needed clearly in a single document and has also included new amendments arising from new developments and knowledge : as for example those concerning new types of propagating material for vines produced from herbaceous cuttings and in vitro propagation .
the desired consolidation of the single market is very much to be welcomed .
there is an urgent need to change or abolish old or outdated provisions so as to remove existing or potential barriers to trade .
as far as I am concerned , French vine propagators should also be in a position to propagate vines for the German or Italian market , and vice versa .
the specific characteristics of wine production and its further development , in particular in technical and scientific areas , make it essential to stipulate detailed technical provisions which will contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market , improve marketing prospects and also protect the legitimate interests of consumers and producers .
accordingly , the Commission should publish a Community catalogue of varieties , compiled on the basis of notifications from the Member States .
this will bring greater trading security for European wine growers .
many amendments contain a better definition of terms such as &apos; genotype &apos; , for example .
accompanying paperwork and controls are important , and the Commission must ensure that only one document is required for each party , wherever they happen to be in Europe .
High-quality and healthy vine propagating material is playing an increasingly important role these days .
the report has taken on a particularly explosive character in the past few weeks .
this is because the Commission is proposing to create a legal basis with regard to genetically modified varieties .
the Commission proposal refers to Council Directive 90 / 220 , which is to regulate all genetically modified material , as a horizontal directive .
we have done the same with respect to forest and plant material .
however , the fact that directive 90 / 220 is still undergoing the conciliation procedure should not stop us from proceeding in taking exactly the same approach with vines as we have done with forest and plant material .
all the amendments that are currently being introduced with regard to directive 90 / 220 , under the conciliation procedure , will be applicable to vines at a later date .
there is no genetically modified vine propagating material available on the market as yet ; however , research is ongoing .
the question as to whether genetically modified vines will be granted a permit at some future date , or whether this idea will be rejected by the wine producers and the wine trade , does not form part of today &apos; s discussion of the directive .
I am sure we will have the opportunity to discuss these matters at length on another occasion .
the directive under discussion today guarantees that traditional vine varieties , which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions , are to be maintained and protected .
traditional wine growing is our strength in the European Union , and so it deserves our support .
I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report as it stands , and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the reason we wished to defer this report was that we wanted to ensure consistency in the work of the European Parliament as it influenced the course of European policy .
the revision of GMO Directive No 90 / 220 is at the conciliation stage right now .
it would be completely inconsistent not to wait until the end of this procedure before including references to GMOs in our directives and regulations .
that is why , at the proposal of the draftsman of the opinion , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has unanimously voted to do away with all the references to GMOs in this report .
and please do not tell us that we are barking up the wrong tree , and that this revision does not have any implications concerning GMOs , since a regulation of this type already exists for forestry .
at the moment , we consume wine , but we do not yet feed on the wood of our forests .
contrary to what the executive committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have us believe , this revision slyly but irremediably introduces genetically modified vines .
this is a clear indication that the European Parliament would , indirectly , give the green light to GMO experiments in the field of vine propagation or improvement .
why the rush ?
it is not at the request of the winegrowers or wine merchants or vineyard owners .
on 5 July , some of these issued the Beaune declaration , expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector .
we have received a reply from the Confederation of producers of registered designation of origin ( AOC ) wine , saying , &quot; We support the position of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , as it offers the guarantee that European regulations are not going to permit the implementation of procedures to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine-growing materials which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing . &quot;
just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs ?
the question - and the answer , of course - will have to come from the Commission , who must also tell us whether it is intending to continue to pave the way for us to end up with GMOs on our plates , and now in our glasses too .
this is something that they are achieving , unfortunately , with the assistance of the French Presidency , in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumers feel .
the previous directive proved to be relevant and effective in enabling , firstly , products to be standardised and the internal Community trade in vine cuttings and plants to develop substantially in recent years .
it now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress , particularly in the field of in vitro propagation .
the draft text presented by the European Commission , as amended by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , proposes some interesting advances . I shall cite the most significant here .
the current draft rules out any possibility of any of the Fifteen Member States enjoying a unilateral exemption from the terms of the directive .
this provision , which was not laid down in the initial version of the directive , is preferable as it makes it possible to avoid barriers to trade and to facilitate the movement of propagation material within the European Union .
the material produced by in vitro herbaceous cutting propagation techniques , which by now have been sufficiently mastered were , of course , not covered by the 1968 directive .
the new text introduces provisions recognising special characteristics . while research into a propagation material that is more efficient in health terms is of benefit to the user , it is important that this approach does not create a barrier to trade .
the draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the European Union material that complies with the minimum requirements of the directive should be approved unreservedly .
finally , we must ensure that the new provisions on genetically modified varieties are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts , or texts in preparation , in this field .
should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified , it would be preferable to delete the provisions relating to this point from the draft directive .
we have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this .
the regulations proposed by the directive , moreover , favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees , which is a basic requirement , in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector , which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing .
Mr President , the need for a new directive revising the conditions for the marketing on Community territory of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine has become urgent .
the base legislation in force dates from 1968 , a long way back , and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then : new materials have been tried out , often using natural methods and sometimes genetic modification .
hence the urgent need for a modern regulation which recognises these new possibilities available to European vine growers and , at the same time , protects traditional varieties of vine .
it is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted , particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90 / 220 , in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs .
another amendment , tabled by Mr Garot and myself , refers once again to the precautionary principle and provides for the protection of those traditional forms of vine which would otherwise be overtaken by new experimental varieties .
I also feel that , abiding by this precautionary principle , referring to the possibility of genetic modification , means , for example , cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments .
the amendments tabled by Mrs Auroi and the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmen , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf as a further guarantee precisely of experimental varieties , are precautionary .
from this point of view , I therefore consider that Mrs Klass &apos; report follows the right lines in a sector which is in urgent need of new legislation , a key , strategic sector for agriculture and the European wine industry .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what is the point of turning a technical report into a potential oenological disaster .
the determination to amend the directive on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine may look like a laudable initiative to update a rather technical text , which is 32 years old .
personally , I find the &apos; 68 vintage rather a fine one , but apparently the Commission has decided to modernise .
the very first lines of the Klass report clearly stress the value , not just the economic value but also the cultural value , of grape and wine production .
everything , then , could be for the best in the best of all possible European wine-growing worlds .
well , as it turns out , that is not the case .
the Commission has taken the opportunity of updating matters to open a Pandora &apos; s box , even though this was something that not one European producer was looking for .
while the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever , Mrs Klass goes further and goes into convulsions , compounding the GMO issue with all the genotypes she sees all around her .
it must be said loud and clear , there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90 / 220 , which is currently being revised , unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs .
and please do not tell me that this was done to anticipate this directive &apos; s being revised or because GM vines do not exist except in laboratory experiments !
Commissioner , Mrs Klass , listen to the opinions of the experts from the Institut national des appellations d &apos;origine , the French National Appellations institute .
the INAO has , on the basis of the information currently available , issued a blanket ban on the use of GMOs in any area whatsoever , which would therefore include , and I quote , genetically modified wine varieties and rootstocks .
would you care to read the Beaune declaration presented by the winegrowers of the Burgundy region ?
do you wish to show the industry that Europe is working for better quality and respects the precautionary principle ?
Commissioner , withdraw the recitals and the articles incorporating GMOs and cloning into this draft .
Mrs Klass , take out your amendments and let the relationship between GMOs and genotypes be clarified by the scientists .
there is a second problem area , Mrs Klass .
you restrict the practice of grafting to herbaceous cuttings alone .
in so doing , you protect what goes on in your own region , but rule out the grafting of hardwood cuttings in the winter period , even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe .
this amendment should , therefore , be withdrawn .
in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter , should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn , then , as the wine growers themselves demand , we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler B√©guin , and the Committee on the Environment , and vote against them .
Mr President , rapporteur , I would like to congratulate you on your report .
there has been some turmoil lately , and I believe the genetically modified organisms will , of course , be inclined to dispute the purport of this directive .
but in all fairness , it has to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material .
it has had no place in viticulture so far .
I am fundamentally opposed to genetically modified organisms and am a wine lover , and I would very much like to stick with the wine we have been producing to date .
I therefore welcome the fact that we have placed additional emphasis on traditional , regional types of wine .
when it comes to genetically modified material , I take the view that the reference made in this report to directive 90 / 220 secures legal protection .
any prospective changes , will , and must , be made to this end .
in addition , Mrs Klass , it is , however , important to stress the political dimension as well as the legal aspect , particularly where viticulture is concerned , and - providing we manage to do so - to keep viticulture free of genetically modified material if at all possible .
I hope that the wine growers will have no truck with GMOs , for their own sake , because we know that consumers strongly disapprove .
I hope this will inspire us to rule out the possibility of having genetically modified vines .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur , Mrs Klass , for their extremely positive reception of the Commission &apos; s proposal .
the Commission appreciates the wide consensus on its proposal .
its aim is to strengthen the internal market in the sector in question , to update the legislation in the light of technical and scientific progress which has taken place since it was last updated and to ensure that authorisation for genetically modified varieties can only be granted if the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health or the environment .
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has tabled 26 amendments .
the Commission is able to accept the majority of them , that is 24 out of 26 amendments , as they are currently worded or with minor changes relating to the way they are worded or presented .
for example , the proposal to recognise the specific characteristics of the genotype , referred to in Amendments Nos 4 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 20 , will be incorporated by changing the wording of the text .
the genetic diversity of the varieties with genotypes which are suitable for specific local environments will be taken into consideration in discussions on the appropriateness of continuing the possibility of marketing material for propagating these varieties , on the basis of Article 3 , paragraph 5 , point A of the directive .
with reference to the other two amendments , Amendments Nos 2 and 18 , we can only partially accept them for the reason that certain aspects are unjustifiably aggressive towards other countries - Amendment 2 - or because the reference to the Commission &apos; s obligation to provide greater resources should a common catalogue of varieties be compiled - Amendment No 18 - is superfluous .
lastly , we can accept Amendment No 27 , tabled by both Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot .
I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40 , tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90 / 220 .
however , we cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 to 34 tabled by Mrs Isler-B√©guin and others , for they would involve revoking the entire part of the directive which contains references to the GMO varieties and the related risk assessment .
moreover , these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
we cannot accept Amendment No 41 , tabled by Mrs Schierhuber , either , for it concerns an excessively detailed definition in the light of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
if we were to accept this amendment , we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade , which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention and , once again , thank you to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Mr President , if you permit , I should like to ask the Commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , Amendment No 1 .
the response is affirmative , Mr President . the amendment has been accepted .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
( the sitting was closed at 9.17 p.m. )
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Madam President , I see from item 13 of the Minutes , entitled &apos; Communication of the announcement of the removal of Mr le pen from office &apos; , that you presumed to speak on behalf of Parliament , and that the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs presumed to speak on behalf of that committee .
I would simply like to point out that Parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion .
as for Mrs Palacio &apos; s interpretation of events , I have a great deal of respect for the chairman on a personal level but none at all for her interpretation , which derives from a prior decision by the Committee made when it chose to postpone ruling on this issue .
while the Council of State was in the process of examining the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie le pen , the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequences of this appeal , nor even from assessing the decision taken .
this situation seems to me all the more serious since while French law expressly stipulates that a ruling from the Council of State concerning a Member of the European Parliament must be given in plenary session , it was only pronounced in this case by two sub-sections , which constitutes a serious breach of Mr le pen &apos; s rights .
as a result , I consider that Article 7 ( 4 ) of our Rules of Procedure has not been respected .
Mr Gollnisch , I can assure you that procedures have been respected absolutely , in both the spirit and the letter of Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Act of 20 September 1976 .
the only issue open to debate is whether or not I should have taken note of the decree terminating Mr le pen &apos; s mandate as soon as the French government notified me of it .
as you know , the Committee on Legal Affairs advised me to wait for the decision from the Council of State , which I did .
however , everything was done exactly by the book , and in conformity with the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , the Minutes state that I spoke on the situation in Spain .
I spoke on the repression in Spain and the situation in the Basque country , which is totally different .
I would not speak about ETA terrorist acts and say I am speaking about the situation in Spain .
this has not been fairly reported in the Minutes .
I would say that I spoke on the situation in the Basque country and about the Spanish Government &apos; s repression .
you can check it in the verbatim report of proceedings .
Madam President , I speak with regard to item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity .
we opposed this waiver , Madam President , which answers the question that you were just asking , in the name - to quote from paragraph D of Mr MacCormick &apos; s report - in the name of the &quot; independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity &quot; .
I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be &apos; auto nomoi &apos; , which means &apos; having its own laws &apos; , and as the rapporteur says &quot; its own rules &quot; .
yesterday , Madam President , you had discretionary powers , as did Parliament , and there were no limits on this discretionary power .
that was the legal error on your part , Madam President .
Mr Martinez , you have jumped the gun on the vote on the report concerning Mr Pacheco Pereira .
I would remind you that the vote is to take place at 12.30 .
( the Minutes were approved )
Madam President , on a point of order .
following the Danish referendum will you now write to the Danish Prime Minister to congratulate the Danish people on having struck an historic blow for freedom , democracy and the nation state ?
the euro was meant to symbolise the strength and unity of Europe ...
( the President cut off the speaker )
this is not a point of order , Mr Helmer .
at least in this case , that is very clear .
informal European Council in Biarritz ( 13 / 14 October 2000 )
the next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the informal European Council in Biarritz , held on 13 and 14 October 2000 .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is my pleasure to return to this House - as the French Presidency undertook to do on 3 October - to present the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz to which , Madam President , you , as ever , made a highly valued contribution .
as I have mentioned previously , most of the time available was taken up with the institutional reforms currently being examined at the Intergovernmental Conference , which I think was as it should be , and I will therefore begin with them .
as to the IGC , I believe that work at ministerial level had already progressed as far as it could before Biarritz , and this informal Council thus came at the just the right time to consolidate certain advances and to lay down guidelines for the final phase of the work , on which we have now embarked .
let me expand on the issue of qualified majority voting .
a fairly broad consensus was reached on over half of the items under discussion , while ways of arriving at potential solutions to sensitive issues were also outlined .
thus , while certain deep-seated reservations persist concerning taxation , some form of progress will still be possible thanks to the technical adjustments that the Presidency is to look into with the help of the Commission .
we have established that there is a clear desire to open up to cooperation in the area of combating tax fraud , and this is no small thing .
I feel that we should also be able to make headway in the field of social affairs , on the proviso that we do not tamper with the principles that underpin the various national social security systems , which gives us some room for manoeuvre .
progress will also be possible in the field of external trade policy , but only when we find a way of dealing with the most sensitive issues on a specific basis and also avert a backdoor extension of Community competences .
in the field of justice and home affairs , I am optimistic that a solution will be found concerning judicial cooperation in civil cases .
on the other hand , issues relating to asylum , visas and immigration are still proving much more sensitive .
lastly , certain other problems remain , not least in the field of non-discrimination and the environment .
significant progress has thus been made even if certain advances still have to be consolidated .
concerning closer cooperation , all the Member States now agree on the value of this and acknowledge the need to inject flexibility into the arrangements for putting it into practice .
finally , in the field of foreign , security and defence policy , I believe that specially tailored measures must be pinpointed in order to cater for the specific nature of the issues involved .
concerning the Commission and the re-weighting of votes , two issues which are closely interrelated and politically charged , the discussions revealed a consensus on the need to make the Commission stronger and more effective . having said that , I must admit that not a great deal was actually said , because there remains a very marked rift over how this is to be achieved .
some Member States advocate setting a definitive ceiling on the number of Commissioners , in tandem with a rotation of posts among the Member States on an equal footing , while others champion a system of one Commissioner per Member State , without ruling out the possibility of a radical restructuring of the college .
both options remain on the table , and must be assessed in the light of their potential for ensuring that the common interests of the Community are safeguarded .
concerning the weighting of votes , the two well-known systems also remain on the table : a simple re-weighting , in favour of which a narrow , very narrow majority is emerging , or a double majority system , but with alternative options , a double simple or double re-weighted majority , in other words a type of &apos; demographic safety net &apos; .
it is clear that we will only be able to take a decision on these issues after negotiations have come to a close ; nevertheless , discussions based on detailed proposals must continue in order to prepare for the final decision at nice .
work will now continue in a very intensive manner up to nice , on the basis of the informal guidelines adopted by this European Council .
we thus have a little under fifty days left .
the preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on closer cooperation , on very concrete bases .
it also went into greater detail in its work on amending Article 7 of the Treaty in accordance with the positive guidelines laid down at Biarritz .
the preparatory group is to play a full role up until 19 November , the date of the next ministerial level meeting .
we will therefore hold a total of six ministerial-level working sessions between now and nice . four of these will be mini-sessions and two will take the form of a conclave , and we expect to turn all these occasions to good account in order to keep alive the Biarritz spirit .
finally , a word on a related subject , but one which I know to be of fundamental importance for the European Parliament : the Charter of Fundamental Rights . I can tell you that the European Council unanimously commended the quality of this text , which can therefore be formally proclaimed at nice in the form that it was transmitted by the Convention .
the matter of its incorporation into the Treaties was quite rightly not dealt with at Biarritz .
it is nevertheless clear that the majority of Member States are not yet prepared to do this , and it is my belief - this is not my wish , but simply my impression - that it will only be possible to formally raise this issue further down the line .
I will now turn to international issues , which were also very much to the fore at Biarritz .
you will all be aware of the events that were going on at the time this Summit was held with , on the one hand , the situation in the Middle East , and on the other the political changes in Serbia , which found expression in the visit to Biarritz by the new President of Serbia , Mr Kostunica .
I will not dwell on the events in the Middle East .
I will simply point out that , right from the outset , the European Union has called on both sides to strive to put an end to the violence , to reopen dialogue and safeguard what had been achieved at Camp David , and the Biarritz European Council called both sides to a summit meeting .
the European Union continued to make its voice heard , the voice of reason and conciliation , at Sharm-el-Sheikh , where it was represented for the first time by Mr Solana , the High Representative for the CFSP - a fact that I would emphasise as I do not subscribe to the opinion that Europe is playing a diminished role in the Middle East , but actually one that is becoming gradually more important again .
unfortunately , it has proved impossible since Sharm-el-Sheikh to implement the agreement worked out there , and the tensions on both sides remain considerable , to say the least , with the European Union therefore monitoring the situation with the greatest of vigilance .
we must recapture the spirit that reigned in the Oslo Agreements , and this is the ambition of this Presidency , all the Member States , the High Representative , and the Commission and Parliament .
the second event that stood out at Biarritz , for the right reasons this time , was the return of democracy to Serbia and , more than this , the repercussions of the political changes in Belgrade on relations between that country and the European Union .
I am sure that the events leading up to the investiture of Vojislav Kostunica will still be fresh in your minds . this investiture and these events have seen a completely new political order being installed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , opening the way to the democratisation of the country and , let us hope , a more widespread reconciliation in the Balkans .
the European Union has honoured its commitments and responded to this political turnaround at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 9 October , at which it decided to lift the sanctions , including the oil and air embargoes , imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998 , with the exception of course of sanctions directly aimed at Mr Milosevic and his entourage .
President Kostunica therefore accepted the invitation from the Presidency to go to Biarritz and have lunch with Heads of State and Government .
at the joint press conference he held alongside the French Presidency , Mr Kostunica expressed his heartfelt joy at being welcomed into the European family , for this is exactly what is happening .
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will , of course , very soon benefit from the instruments that have been set in place by the Union to cover the entire Balkan region , beginning with the cards programme and also the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction .
furthermore , the General Affairs Council confirmed the Union &apos; s intention to contribute to re-establishing navigation on the Danube and to actively participate in modernising infrastructures in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within a regional context .
moreover , without prejudice to a needs assessment and the coordination of economic and financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , which are to be the joint responsibility of the European Commission and the World Bank , the Biarritz European Council decided to grant the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia initial emergency Humanitarian aid totalling EUR 200 million .
lastly , and I will end here - this is without doubt the most important decision in the medium and long term - the Union has decided to provide this country with a political prospect by proposing that it conclude a stabilisation and association agreement along the lines of those currently being negotiated with the other countries in the same region .
it was precisely with this in mind that President Kostunica was invited , as you will be aware , to take part in the summit meeting between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans , which is to be held in Zagreb , at the instigation of the President of the French Republic , on 24 November .
these are the issues that can be singled out concerning the developments and situation in Serbia and their repercussions for the Union .
I feel that the important thing was for the Union to very swiftly communicate to this country not only a tangible message of encouragement but also , and I would stress this point , the political prospect of its full and comprehensive integration into the European family .
I believe that this message has been clearly given .
we can only hope that the process of democratisation is able to continue under optimum conditions .
these , in a nutshell , were the results of the Biarritz European Council which was , and I say this in all sincerity because I believe it to be true , highly productive and therefore of great value to the step forward that the Union is of course still to complete .
Madam President , I would now , in turn , like to give the Commission &apos; s impressions following the Biarritz European Council , to which you , Madam President , made an active contribution , along with another eminent member of this House , Mrs M√©ndez de Vigo , who presented the results of work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Moscovici , has spoken of something that he has dubbed the &apos; Biarritz spirit &apos; .
one might talk of the Biarritz spirit or frame of mind , and also the climate at Biarritz .
ladies and gentlemen , I can truly say that the climate in which discussions took place genuinely matched the climatic conditions that prevailed in Biarritz for the two days we were there .
the weather was cloudy and windy but it was , all things considered , an invigorating climate and , I felt , just the type of dynamic climate that we needed at that stage of the discussions , in which I myself noticed many stumbling blocks , far more stumbling blocks than can always be explained away by the delicacy of the issues .
we needed this invigorating climate , as Mr Moscovici has said , and I too sensed among the Heads of State and of Government a very solemn air of collective and historic responsibility at this historic juncture for European integration .
there seemed to be a genuine sense of purpose and , in any event , the will to achieve real reform at nice .
much has been said , in the press and elsewhere , of the rift between larger States and smaller States , or less populous countries .
these divergences of opinion are a fact .
everyone is conscious of them , but there is none of the hostility which is sometimes described .
in this connection , I would prefer to talk of a moment of truth in the debate , rather than a moment of crisis .
above all , I would like to say , as someone who has , from the start and on a daily basis , been involved in these discussions as one of the workmen , alongside your representatives Mr Brok and Professor Tsatsos , that this rift is not the only one that might exist between large and small States .
it is not even , it would seem to me , the central issue in these discussions if one recalls , and this is something that must be remembered and recalled , that ever since the process of European integration began , there has never been a case , either in the Council or within the Commission , of large countries forming a coalition against small countries , or of small States forming a coalition against large countries .
this runs counter to the spirit of the Community .
as regards my feelings on this matter , I am aware of and understand the sensitivity of the issues that the Minister has described , issues which directly relate to the position , the role , and the influence of each country .
I perceived this sensitivity during the visits I made to each of the Member States , and also last week in Athens , with regard both to the Commission , with each country concerned at the position that would be assigned to it , and to the voting system , with each country concerned at the number of votes it is to have in the Council .
ladies and gentlemen , we must find a solution to these two issues , which will in fact only be resolved when negotiations are complete , and on which we must reach total agreement if that agreement is to mean anything at all .
with regard to the Commission , a solution must be found that preserves its effectiveness , its credibility , and if possible its collegiate nature .
with regard to the voting system , we must find a solution which respects - as both the Commission and the European Parliament have proposed - the twofold legitimacy of , on the one hand , the Member States and , on the other , the peoples of Europe .
but if I had to tell you spontaneously and very sincerely how I felt , I would say this : regardless of the sensitivity of these issues - the composition of the Commission and the voting system - they cannot be used as criteria for assessing whether nice is a success or a failure .
the success or failure of the nice Council will depend on the ability of the Heads of State and Government , and on the ability of Parliament and the Commission , as parties to the negotiations , to preserve or consolidate the Community model .
in saying this , ladies and gentlemen , I have in mind a number of points that are still under discussion .
whether the Community system is preserved or weakened will depend on the scope of qualified majority voting and thus of codecision being extended to cover real issues .
that is my first point .
the preservation or strengthening of the Community model will be assessed on the basis of whether we have been able to resist the temptation felt by some to call into question the exclusivity of the Commission &apos; s powers to initiate legislation .
I am referring here to Article 250 , for which some would like to introduce qualified majority voting .
the preservation and consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the Commission has been reserved a fitting role in closer cooperation , and not only as concerns the first pillar .
the consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the role of agencies has been allowed to develop to the detriment of the regulatory authority that belongs to the Commission .
that , ladies and gentlemen , from my viewpoint as someone who , let me repeat in all modesty , is one of the humble workmen in these discussions , is what I say and think is the way to gauge whether or not genuine reform has been achieved in nice .
I would like to follow what the Minister has said by quickly touching on some of the points that I have just mentioned .
qualified majority voting : I would stress that the issue is not really about how many fields could be changed from unanimity to qualified majority voting .
the real issue is the status of these fields , and the great merit of the Biarritz Summit will have been that of defining the most problematic areas and encouraging us , or authorising us , to find technical solutions for taxation issues , or in any case for the small section of taxation policy , or of social protection , which relates directly to the internal market .
there is a need to reassure those who are worried that under no circumstances will the sovereignty of the Member States in taxation matters be challenged , and to also tell those who have worries that the idea is not to merge social protection systems , especially from the bottom up , but simply to see to it that the common market and the single market run smoothly within an enlarged Europe .
trade policy , asylum and immigration , cohesion policy , environmental policy : in each of these fields several approaches to solutions have been sounded out and , as early as yesterday morning , the group of representatives was back at work .
following on from what Mr Moscovici has said , I would like to state that the Commission is no mere bystander in this work .
it is playing its part and is ready and willing , alongside the Presidency , to seek out the fairest solutions .
ladies and gentlemen , we must quite simply see to it that from now on we keep alive the spirit and climate of Biarritz as regards these qualified majority voting issues .
naturally , as regards all these areas , where the transition to qualified majority voting is involved , I would like to reiterate our intention to extend codecision where legislative matters are concerned .
as Mr Moscovici has said , genuine progress has also been made concerning closer cooperation .
it is interesting to note that many delegations feel that we have to turn this progress on closer cooperation to good account , and this is along the lines of what I was saying earlier , in order to strengthen the role of the Community institutions - the role of the Commission , but also that of Parliament .
I feel that the fundamental demands made by Parliament and the Commission will be met or honoured , and that on this point we will manage to secure the abolition of recourse to the European Council , which is to say the right of veto , along with a lowering of the quorum to one third , or eight , of the Member States in Community matters .
it was made eminently clear at Biarritz that closer cooperation would constitute an additional force for integration and not an instrument of exclusion .
Mr Moscovici has spoken of the Charter .
in drafting this instrument , work of high quality has been carried out in an original and intelligent manner .
I feel that it will go on to be proclaimed at nice , and this already marks a great step forward .
we cannot stop there and at nice we will need to envisage ways of addressing the place that this Charter is to have within the Treaties .
these are issues that we do not have time to deal with thoroughly prior to nice , but they must be raised and would perhaps merit in-depth attention after nice .
ladies and gentlemen , there are still a great many thorny issues in these complex negotiations which can only be resolved by universal agreement . I would like to confirm that the Biarritz spirit or the Biarritz climate would seem to me to have been primarily one of determination .
Madam President , I will quickly mention some other issues , if I may , to confirm or expand upon what the Presidency has said .
first , Serbia .
everyone here has been deeply moved and heartened by the move to democracy in Serbia - firstly by the will of the people of Serbia and by the election of President Kostunica as President of the Yugoslav Federation .
this is what has caused the European Union to radically alter its policy in respect of Serbia .
I must say that President Kostunica &apos; s visit to Biarritz was an important and moving event which marked the return of Serbia to the European fold .
in more practical terms , we announced that emergency aid totalling EUR 200 million had been allocated to Serbia , and the Commission is soon to present a package of emergency measures that will cater for the country &apos; s priority needs as winter approaches .
besides the emergency aid , there can be no doubt that Serbia will also need , as Mr Moscovici has indicated , more comprehensive support , which will be implemented in association with the World Bank and the EIB among others .
the key thing , here as elsewhere , I feel , is to consolidate democracy .
the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned about the Middle East .
I will not dwell on this issue except to remind you that the European Council adopted a declaration that exerted pressure on both sides in the conflict to actually meet at Sharm-el-Sheikh .
this meeting did indeed take place .
we are aware of what was achieved there and we too feel that it was important that Javier Solana , the European Union &apos; s High Representative , should play an active part in these talks .
I would like to conclude by mentioning two issues that are of concern to this House and which have spurred the Commission to take action - crude oil and maritime safety .
these issues were also dealt with at Biarritz . the Heads of State and Government welcomed the proposal from the Commission , presented by Loyola de Palacio , for a global strategy on oil reserves and oil prices .
the President of the Commission , Romano Prodi , took the opportunity to emphasise , above and beyond the content of this Communication , the vital importance of Russia to this debate , and suggested that we discuss this issue thoroughly at the forthcoming summit meeting between the European Union and Russia in Paris on 30 October .
lastly , on the subject of maritime safety and the lessons to be learned from the Erika disaster , a few months ago the European Council ratified the guidelines we had proposed , and which were presented to you , on Community strategy in the field of maritime safety .
as you know , these centre around three basic objectives : stepping up inspections of ships in port , stringent monitoring of classification societies and implementing a timetable throughout the Union for replacing single-hulled oil tankers .
the French Presidency is determined to carry through the necessary reforms in this field before the year is out and , on the basis of the proposals from the Commission , to inject fresh impetus into this area at the nice European Council .
( applause )
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the moment of truth has arrived .
we have to make decisions in nice to avoid endangering enlargement , which is our main priority .
the President-in-Office of the Council has spoken of the spirit of nice .
we must not kill the spirit of nice with boredom , and we therefore have an essential priority in the remaining 50 days : to bring negotiations to a political level .
it would be better if this were done publicly as in the case of the Convention , but in any event , we cannot once again restructure the Intergovernmental Conference , which has been treading water for nine months without making any progress at all .
with regard to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council , Parliament has no essential criticisms .
we can be nice for once .
there is one basic issue , however , that I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify .
the Commissioner has talked about qualified majorities and codecision .
the President-in-Office of the Council has not .
our understanding is that the relationship is automatic : anything voted upon by qualified majority in the Council must immediately also be subject to codecision with Parliament .
I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point .
secondly , I would also ask him to clarify for the Assembly whether the distribution of seats in Parliament is currently a topic for debate at the Intergovernmental Conference , because here we are doing nothing but criticise the Council - which sometimes gives us ample cause for criticism - but we must not neglect our own responsibilities .
I have already publicly condemned , here in this Chamber , our inability to distribute the small increase to 700 seats .
I think we can also set an example , as we have done in the past , by distributing between large and small countries .
I also think that we are not currently fulfilling our responsibilities if we are not capable of solving this problem .
I am particularly addressing the groups that are blocking this decision in Parliament , starting with the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
then there is the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
if we all agree that the Charter is a very important document , which we all support and which , furthermore , is a symbol of collective identity , I cannot understand what we are going to do with the Charter .
are we going to keep it in a box ?
are we going to save it for a rainy day ?
in my opinion , it should be the frontispiece of a future Constitution , but at the moment , what we could do and what could easily be achieved in nice , is to include the Charter in the Treaty by means of an extremely simple link : Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union .
I would ask the Commission and the Council to make a statement on this matter .
this is an important topic for current and future Member States .
in this respect I would also like to address my colleagues in the European People &apos; s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly , we should also advocate outside it .
it is also absolutely unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi &apos; s party in the Italian Parliament voted against this Charter and that a Member of this Assembly used coarse , pre or post-fascist language in relation to the Charter .
we must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments .
we must do so because these values are essential for everyone .
in this respect , I would also ask that a clear announcement be made regarding the proposal we are making , as we believe it makes political sense .
in conclusion , Madam President , two final comments regarding fundamental matters of external policy .
on the one hand , the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event .
the important thing is that we help the Balkans to achieve stability , not instability .
to this end , I believe that we should apply the same standards to all .
we cannot ask Croatia to cooperate with the International Court and not demand the same of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
we must find money - and here the Council has responsibilities - to assert our community of values and create a balanced , stabilising policy in the Balkans .
with regard to the Middle East , it is clear that one of the causes of the situation - not the only cause , as this matter is far more complex - is that the European Union in the past was vetoed as a potential mediator .
the step that has been taken should be applauded , although it was in a situation in which responsibilities had to be shared .
I believe that we must honour our commitment in one of the most tragic situations we are experiencing today .
Madam President , firstly I praise the European Council for accepting the draft Charter as definitive .
from what we know of the performance of the Prime Ministers and Presidents at Biarritz on the trickiest questions of Treaty reform , the Charter will probably become the greatest trophy at nice .
so why is the French Presidency trying to suppress the question of the installation of the Charter within the Treaty ?
President Chirac , with his usual capacity for surprise , said in his press statement that the Charter &apos; s legal status would be a question for the Swedish Presidency .
what does that mean ?
what on earth is Sweden supposed to achieve that France cannot ?
surely it is for the European Council at nice to consider whether the Charter should be inserted inside the Treaty .
that is what the IGC is for .
I would urge the French Presidency quickly to reassess its position on that central point .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the enlargement of the Union is a means of increasing stability and safety in Europe and of promoting tolerance and democracy .
however , it is just as vital that there is reform of the Union &apos; s institutions so as to ensure that the stability of the Union itself does not go under in a climate of indecisiveness on the one hand and public indifference and repugnance on the other .
this would require majority decisions in the Council to become the rule , and likewise , codecision for Parliament , in agricultural matters , for example .
I welcome the declaration of fundamental rights , but it has to be improved in order to better accommodate the citizens &apos; expectations , and it has to form part of a European constitutional process .
it must be integrated in the Treaty .
the development of a credible and democratic Europe requires more involvement from the citizens , the regions , the small and large Member States , more decisiveness on the part of the Commission and a reinforcement of the role of Parliament , but especially the will of the Commission to play its role on behalf of the Union , and this is what we failed to do in the Middle East , for example .
peace must be achieved for the sake of those killed , especially on the Palestinian side and , in order to recover the spirit of Oslo , we must go back to basics .
Israel is entitled to peace and safety but the Palestinians , who had to give up a large part of their land for this , are entitled to their own state , as enshrined in UN resolutions 242 and 338 .
the election of Mr Kostunica is without a doubt a sign of hope to all democrats , but at the same time , the issues of future stability push themselves to the fore in Kosovo , Bosnia and Herzegovina , for peace in the Balkans is fragile and we will need , with immediate effect , to have the means at our disposal to secure reconstruction and future stability in a democratic process .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , while progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting , deep-seated disagreement persists , as you yourself have underlined , concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in Council .
it is indeed a fact that there are still major differences of opinion between larger countries and the smaller countries , which fear the stronger countries setting up a type of Cabinet .
so , in speaking of the Biarritz spirit , I believe that in essence Biarritz reflects the complexity of the challenges facing the Union .
I view it as expressing , along the line of other summits , even if it was an informal one , the contradictions that exist between social requirements and citizens &apos; demands , the expectations of the peoples of Europe , and the free-market rationale that continues to hold sway in the European Union .
there is a pressing need to work out a new design for an enlargement that unites rather than divides , that involves the candidate countries in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and pays far greater attention to the social dimension of enlargement .
I would therefore reiterate my Group &apos; s commitment to a reform that guarantees balance between the European institutions and also between the Member States , and in doing so smaller countries being marginalised .
a reform that also increases transparency and democracy and at last enables the general public to participate in the drafting of European policies .
Biarritz also saw the unanimous adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and , yes , there was indeed great ambition and a novel method .
for the first time in a document of this type , civil , political and social rights were placed on an equal footing , with a commitment to establishing a Community of human values .
I do not for all that share in the Presidency &apos; s satisfaction , and can only regret the fact that the content of the Charter fails to live up to requirements and expectations , not least as regards social issues .
I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve , in order to guarantee , amongst other things , more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the European Union , for employees , for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised .
the Council would truly satisfy the expectations of European citizens if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual communities and national parliaments , culminating in a charter that genuinely met people &apos; s needs .
finally , concerning international issues , I , like others here , am keen to hail the return of democracy to Serbia .
it is very important , as part of the process that has started , for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction , stability and promotion of human rights in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia .
concerning the Middle East , all the signs following Sharm-el-Sheikh are that the peace process depends on certain undertakings being honoured , beginning with the full and comprehensive implementation of the UN resolutions , an end to Israeli colonisation of the occupied territories , the right of displaced Palestinians to return to their Lands , and the recognition of a Palestinian state which has East Jerusalem as its capital .
I too hope that nice European Council is a success and welcome the fact that the peoples of Europe , and large numbers of associations , NGOs and trade unions are investing time and effort in preparing for it .
Madam President , at the Biarritz Council we saw emerging , from behind the real or supposed quarrels between larger and smaller countries , a different but equally real type of rift between those who want to speed up European integration and those who want to preserve a design for a European Union that respects Member States and national democracies .
the first group would seem willing to engage in ultrafederalism within a hard core of States , and the referendum in Denmark seems to have strengthened their convictions on this .
my Group would like to warn them against this .
by persisting in this approach , they would probably cut Europe in half , and even more surely would cut themselves off from their own nation .
for the referendum held on 28 September was not simply an expression of the Danes &apos; refusal to be run by a European superstate and their desire to preserve their national democracy .
it also mirrored the feelings of many citizens in other Member States , even if these feelings are sometimes more abstract given the lack of a means to convey them .
were their voices heard at Biarritz ?
one might well doubt it , in view of the fact that the most clear-cut decision taken during the Biarritz Council was to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at nice .
the ultimate goal of this Charter , should it become binding , would be to strip each national democracy of the right to itself determine the rights and duties of its own citizens .
worse still , the major concern of those promoting the Charter actually seems to be how to make it binding without first having it ratified by the national parliaments .
the decision that it will be proclaimed at nice has already been taken solely by the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
the Commission subsequently informed us , in its Communication of 11 October , that the Charter could be rendered binding through the case law of the Court of Justice , still without any say from the national parliaments .
it will therefore have been possible to strip the nations of Europe of their most fundamental right without ever openly having asked their citizens for an opinion .
it is thus impossible to claim that Biarritz genuinely listened to the demand , as expressed in the referendum in Denmark , that national democracies be respected within the Union .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I do not share Commissioner Barnier &apos; s optimism about maintaining the Community system at nice .
it seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction .
we had a second pillar , then we had a third pillar , and now we are in the process of constructing a fourth pillar on defence , while a de facto fifth pillar also exists on economic and monetary union .
on the other hand , the major points of balance between European institutions are slowly being broken down .
we have a Commission that is weakened and , rather than dealing with such fundamental issues , Parliament is waxing lyrical on somewhat surreal themes , such as a charter that has absolutely no legal basis and which no authority will be entrusted with enforcing , when all of our fifteen Member States have their own charters of fundamental rights .
while this Parliament holds forth on constitutionalisation , the real issue is - and I would stress this - that of the balance of power within the Commission .
I cannot agree with you , Mr Poettering .
the issue is one of not turning the Commission into a second Council by ensuring that each Member State is represented . the issue is that of turning the Commission into a genuine supranational body , an authority for the European Union .
these changes can of course only work to the disadvantage of the smaller States , as might be suspected judging from the manoeuvring of some larger States , who are banking on scenarios for the reweighting of votes and the composition of the Commission and speculating on the future composition of the Commission in order to earn themselves a little extra room for manoeuvre with regard to reweighting .
the real issue is that of giving the Commission , by means of elections , a genuine legitimacy that relates directly to the citizens .
the only way to make Commission stronger is to have the President of the Commission elected by direct universal suffrage and also - why not ? - the Vice-President with responsibility for external relations , in order to at last remove this area from the second pillar .
this is the only way to restore a true balance between the various institutions of the European Union .
but we refuse to talk about such things .
we must therefore urge everyone to return to the roots of our Union , to have the courage that Giscard d &apos; Estaing and Helmut Schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979 , and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a President of the Commission who is also the President of the European Union .
Madam President , the Biarritz Summit was a breakthrough for reinforced cooperation .
the heart of the matter is that the √©lites who are keenest on integration want to be able to make decisions without broad democratic support .
there is no longer any need to take account of those countries in which referendums are required before sovereignty is handed over .
in future , it will be possible to have proposals rejected in referendums and adopt them in any case .
any countries which vote against will sooner or later be pressurised into following suit .
the pattern is familiar from cooperation on issues of legal policy .
first of all , the pioneering countries implement a form of Schengen-style cooperation , and the legislation is subsequently transferred to all the countries .
the most stubborn countries are made a special offer .
they can have the legislation sent to them by fax without exercising any contributory influence .
what they cannot do is avoid the legislation , no matter how many people vote no in the referendums .
Elites in all the countries are also joining forces against their own voters .
those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car .
reinforced cooperation is like an eel trap . there is no way back , but only ever more integration , more centralisation and more Brussels , without the corresponding democracy .
the Group for a Europe of democracies and Diversities wants to see a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be a part of every development and which is characterised by democracy instead of regimentation : a Europe of democracies and diversity .
Madam President , I still remember well the pitying smiles of those delegates who favoured an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference , when I suggested to them back in February this year that we could count ourselves lucky if it proved possible to find a solution to the famous Amsterdam leftovers .
what stage are we at now , eight months on and with the Biarritz Summit behind us ?
apart from hoping to make progress in the matter of extending qualified majority voting , in truth we have not made a great deal of headway .
a new Treaty is just as distant a prospect today as it was eight months ago .
indeed it is clear that the question of the leftovers is going to be a fairly hard nut to crack . there is no prospect of any agreement to my mind .
however , if no solution is found to the key issues , then it will not be possible for work which is at a more advanced stage - for example with regard to the reform of the European Court of Justice - to be included in a new Treaty .
similarly , the stock phrase used by the French , that it is better to have no treaty than a bad one , is unlikely to reinforce anyone &apos; s faith in the attainability of an ambitious goal in nice .
. ( FR ) Madam President , I would like to contribute to this debate by recapitulating on some of the interventions , rather than by replying to them .
I have very little to add to what Commissioner Barnier has said , except perhaps to mention a slight difference of opinion over meteorology .
the weather at Biarritz was in fact quite bad that weekend .
I know the Basque coast very well and was rather disappointed for those participating .
one might have expected somewhat better weather conditions , but I feel that the climate inside the European Council , at which I was present from start to finish , was a little better than the Commissioner has said .
in this respect I would like to respond to what Mr Poettering has said about the rift between the larger and smaller states .
it is true that we arrived at a juncture where marked differences of opinion were evident in the ministerial discussions .
you can in any case rest assured , Mr President , that it is the genuine desire of the Presidency of the Council to seek out a compromise that suits everyone .
accordingly , the President of the French Republic , the President of the European Council and the French Prime Minister asked me to visit , before the President of the French Republic , the ten countries which are currently asking for only one Commissioner .
I immediately went to see the Belgian Prime Minister yesterday evening and moreover believe that he too can sense the Biarritz spirit .
the determination to heal the rift between the smaller and larger countries is an integral part of this spirit .
I do not , in this respect , share the feelings of the Chairman of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party on the possibility of &apos; one Commissioner per Member State &apos; .
I am aware of the criticisms that you have addressed to the German Chancellor .
I am no more qualified than you to meddle in German internal affairs , but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if I am not mistaken also moves into line with what the Commission wants .
a strong and effective Commission means a Commission that has even greater legitimacy by virtue of representing the general interest of the Community , and not by dint of a perceived intrusion of the intergovernmental phenomenon into the way it operates .
when we proposed a rotation on an equal footing , it was precisely to show that the idea was not to pit the smaller and larger countries against one other but that , in a Commission with a ceiling on Commissioners , those countries which we incorrectly refer to as &apos; large &apos; and those that we equally incorrectly call &apos; small &apos; would be represented on a perfectly equal footing .
this is the clear position of the French delegation , and this is clearly the preferable solution .
what I noted in Brussels yesterday , was that an idea is beginning to gain credence , that of having one Commissioner per Member State , which will probably be adopted at nice , perhaps placing a ceiling on the number of Commissioners at a later date .
I therefore believe that we will clear up this ambiguity and that we must do so while effectively ensuring that the Commission continues to be a strong body .
in fact , as Mr Barnier has said extremely clearly , a Commission packed to the rafters and representing the Member States alone would lose credibility and legitimacy .
I share the Commissioner &apos; s views .
the objective is truly one of strengthening the Community framework .
in order to do this , I would reiterate , in the same vein as my response to Mr Prodi at our last meeting , that we must upgrade each of the institutions : the Commission of course , the European Parliament of course , and the Council too .
this is the balance that we must strike .
I would also like to reassure Mr Poettering as to the actions of the French Prime Minister .
the day after Biarritz , the Prime Minister , as some of those present can testify , appeared in person - something that does not always happen - and at length before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , the parliamentary body that brings together members of the national parliaments , the European parliament and the parliaments of candidate countries .
furthermore , the French Parliament held an hour-long question session that was broadcast at peak viewing time and was specifically dedicated to topical European issues , and thus to the results of the Biarritz European Council , during which the Prime Minister spoke at length . you know how things work in the media .
you might say something on Monday or Tuesday , but this does not necessarily mean that you will be questioned about it on the Thursday . you can therefore rest assured of the French Prime Minister &apos; s resolve as regards this Presidency issue .
I would like to briefly return to matters of external trade policy , as this is a very serious matter .
France &apos; s stance on this is no secret , and neither are the positions of a number of other Member States who feel that , when it comes to the field of services , especially cultural matters and even more particularly audiovisual matters , a cautious approach is called for since issues of identity come into play , and I am talking about issues of identity and not exceptions .
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo asked several questions which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision .
I am aware that this is an issue which the European Parliament quite rightly views as very important , and must make clear to the House that I only dealt with the bare bones of the issue of course , given the limited speaking time available to me , but that this issue does not present any difficulties .
moreover , as I to some extent hinted at during our debate prior to Biarritz , the Presidency sees the extension of qualified majority voting as going hand in hand with codecision .
as I am sure everyone here will be pleased to hear , that does not currently constitute a problem area for the Intergovernmental Conference .
I would also like to return to the issue of the number of Members of the European Parliament .
this issue was partially settled at Amsterdam in Article 189 of the Treaty , which set a ceiling of 700 MEPs .
we have started to exchange ideas on this question , from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement .
one delicate issue is still to be resolved , that of how to allocate seats within this ceiling .
I can state that a number of delegations , those from Germany , Britain , France and Italy and also from Holland , would like to see a proportional reduction and others a linear reduction .
we shall have to see , as this will clearly be a sensitive issue .
I would just like to express my disappointment at the fact that the European Parliament has dispensed with drawing up the report that it had announced and which was to have been the subject of an oral question today .
indeed I feel that this would have helped the Member States and not least the Council to form an opinion , as no one could have more definite ideas on this matter than the Members of the European Parliament themselves .
perhaps it is not too late to do this .
I will end with the questions asked by virtually all the speakers concerning the binding nature of the Charter , and am anxious to make myself clearly understood on his matter .
firstly , all the members of the European Council are happy with the Charter , both from the standpoint of the method used and from that of its content .
I will very quickly repeat that the Convention method is an innovative one which enables several legitimate authorities to be combined , the national parliaments , the European Parliament , the Commission and the governments . it is therefore something on which we could perhaps draw in the future when addressing other issues .
the content of this Charter could indeed be interpreted in several different ways : the glass is either half full or half empty , it is a compromise .
I see this compromise as a rather dynamic , gradual and progressive one .
this text will stand out because it is clear and because it is accessible .
it is the first European Union document that the citizens can consult without feeling completely alienated from its content .
that really is something valuable , as was emphasised by all the members of the European Council .
there remains , of course , the question of its legal power .
I will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process , one in which we are well versed , of having the Charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions .
it has to be said that within the European Council there are a number of delegations , and I might even say a large number of delegations , that are opposed to the Charter being binding in nature , and therefore to it being incorporated into the Treaties as early as nice .
given the circumstances , how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development ?
we will strive for this change , as our Presidential role dictates , but I would not want to lead Parliament to believe that developments that cannot come about will come about .
I do not think it will happen .
it seems to me that we must adopt a gradual approach to this matter : see to it that this Charter is proclaimed at nice by the three institutions and then go into its legal future since I , like many people here , believe that it will indeed be the preamble to a future constitutional treaty , but let us then address this as a constituent issue .
in reality only one process or one procedure is still to be addressed and that is the reference to Article 6 .
I have already had occasion in this House to tell you that I was in favour of this .
little was said about the issue at the European Council , but I had the impression that one delegation - you can probably guess which - was reticent , as it is opposed to the Charter having any legal effect or being in any way binding .
lastly , in response to Mrs Ainardi , I see it as very difficult and even quite dangerous to open up the Charter package and discuss its content again , as I do not know what the end result of this re-examination would be .
I strongly believe that this would be taking a step backwards rather than a step forwards .
now that we have this Charter , let us accept it for what it is , as the stage we have reached today , a first step that is subsequently to be confirmed and developed by taking others , whether in respect of its content or its legal status .
secondly , the position of this Parliament has never been that the Charter was to be the preamble to the Treaties .
this idea has appeared from somewhere but it is not the position of the European Parliament . when we talk of insertion we do not mean that we want it to be the preamble .
in any event , Madam President , I believe that Biarritz has contributed something very positive , and that is the unanimous approval of the Charter .
a second very positive thing was the adoption of the Charter in its entirety .
it also seems possible to me - and we are talking about policy - not to put the Charter on ice , to use Mr Bar√≥n Crespo &apos; s expression , but to entrust it to the Swedish Presidency for its incorporation to be studied .
it therefore seems that mentioning the Charter in the Treaty of nice is something that makes perfect sense .
I therefore believe that with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow , we are giving a very clear mandate to our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , to enable them to present a proposal to this end at the nice Summit .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I have three comments to make .
firstly , one sometimes had the impression that at Biarritz there was an obsession with the debate between the smaller and the larger states .
in a certain sense all this is quite natural .
we are at last in the process of reopening the issue of major institutional balances and the way they would work within an enlarged Europe .
the institutions on which the European Union is currently based were set up for three large countries and three small countries .
this balance has not been revised since then .
indeed , the magic of the European Union is precisely its ability to foster alliances between small and large countries in the common interest .
however , if the notion of a common interest is to work , each country must find its proper place .
everyone knows that if a larger Member State does not feel itself to be adequately represented and feels unable to make its voice heard as loudly as it should be within the European institutions , it will look elsewhere , which is in the interests of neither the larger nor the smaller Member States .
that is the reason why we hear so much talk of smaller and larger states .
beyond this , it would seem to me that the Biarritz Council scored several points on this issue , which is crucial to the future of the European Union and its decision-making procedures , and we can only welcome that .
the second issue that I would like to address is that of decision-making .
basically , if the European Union is not in a position to take decisions , it will no longer be in a position to govern .
the markets alone will do this .
so , if we want to be able to govern and decide matters , then decisions must be taken by a qualified majority , including those on non-discrimination .
no one in this Parliament would understand it if no agreement on this issue was reached at nice .
I ask you in all sincerity , at a time when the Union is providing itself with a Charter of Fundamental Rights , would the Heads of State and Government reject the idea of decisions in this area being taken on a qualified majority ?
that would seem to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and I hope that headway can be made on this matter between now and nice .
however , in parallel with the debate on qualified majority voting , there is the debate on closer cooperation .
on this count , I consider it insufficient to say that the Community method must be safeguarded .
we must say how , while remaining well aware that certain issues still have to be settled .
we need to have further debate and focus our thoughts in this respect .
we can say yes to Parliamentary control of closer cooperation , but how can this be put into effect without recreating conditions that are so restrictive that they do not allow this cooperation to be developed ?
these are questions that we still have to answer .
lastly , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I believe that I have never as an MEP given up on anything so long as a glimmer of hope remained . we have taken on board what you said concerning the timetable for incorporating the Charter into the Treaties .
for all that , it is essential that the Treaty adopted at nice should include a reference to Article 6 , for at least three reasons .
Mr M√©ndez de Vigo has already referred to the content of Article 6 and to the inappropriateness of there simply being a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights .
however , in its Communication of 11 October , the Commission has just spelt out , quite correctly , the extent to which a judge to whom this Charter is submitted would be in a position to uphold its content , and would not be able to act as if this document did not exist .
consequently , should the Heads of State and Government say nothing at nice , they would be leaving the door open to what others have called &apos; government by the judges &apos; .
finally , it does not seem to me particularly rational for the President-in-Office of the Council to say that the Swedish Presidency will subsequently look at the action the Fifteen Member States want to take with regard to the Charter &apos; s legal status .
are we to imagine that discussions on the drafting of the Treaty will reopen straight after nice and that a new process of ratification by the fifteen national parliaments will then be embarked upon ?
I believe that to be unrealistic .
there is a pressing need to equip the Union with a point of reference based on the content of this Charter .
I hope we can still convince people of this and make progress , in order to win the day on this issue at nice .
the meeting in Biarritz was typified by very strange happenings .
it therefore comes as no surprise that governments clashed on essential issues .
after all , they are now discussing the redistribution of power in Europe , but especially at this stage , it is vital to have a sound presidency that seeks consensus .
unfortunately , France acted more as a spokesperson for its own interests and for those of the large countries than for proposals which could bridge those contradictions , even if Mr Moscovici is now trying to convince us that the opposite is true .
if the French Presidency carries on like this , the IGC will fall flat on its face on nice &apos; s hard pebble beach .
it is of major importance for each Member State to continue to be represented in the Commission .
a hierarchy becomes inevitable , as this is also what tends to happen in national governments .
even once the present candidate countries have joined , each Member State must be able to retain one junior or senior Commissioner .
it is highly suspicious that the large Member States , which are behind intergovernmental cooperation , would argue in favour of a small Commission in which they themselves would not always be represented .
a rotation system of this kind would lead to a serious weakening of the Commission &apos; s position and that is exactly what we want to avoid .
if the large Member States ask for the votes in the Council to be redistributed to a certain degree , then that is a reasonable request , but if they over-react , they will antagonise the small countries .
in addition , majority decision-making goes , by definition , hand in hand with codecision ; it is totally unacceptable to us to separate the two .
reinforced cooperation works very well with a minimum of eight Member States .
for foreign and security policy , we could possibly do with fewer .
it is difficult but certainly not impossible to reach agreement in nice .
but the French Presidency should not act as strangely as it did in &quot; Bizarritz &quot; .
Madam President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council . I have two minutes and two messages : one on the Charter and one on taxation policy .
concerning the Charter , you have just replied in a very well reasoned manner , but my Group is nonetheless anxious to say to you that the work must go on .
work must continue , first of all , in respect of the content , if not now then at some time in the future at least , because we need more than just fine words .
from the outset the Convention worked on the assumption that the Charter would be binding .
as a result , we negotiated on an a minima basis and we have a minimal Charter , particularly as regards social rights .
I can cite two practical examples : on the one hand we shifted the emphasis from the right to work to the right to engage in work and , on the other hand , a number of social rights that are covered in the revised Social Charter of the Council of Europe are not included in the Charter .
faced with this paradox of having negotiated a binding charter and then ended up with a minimal text and a non-binding charter , there is a real need , as some of the other Members have said , to take a series of decisions at nice .
a first course of action would be that of Article 6 .
a second course of action would be to actually establish a timetable at nice and a clear method for rewriting the Treaties and incorporating the Charter into these Treaties .
a third and final course of action , which no one has talked about but which seems to me very important , is the need to also incorporate a revision clause into the Charter so that we have a dynamic rather than a static text .
concerning taxation policy , Mr Barnier has quite rightly said that qualified majority voting is the criterion for an ambitious Treaty .
I have to say that Article 93 , in the form in which it has been drawn up by the Presidency , does not enable us to address even a straightforward debate .
if we want to pursue the objectives that the Union has set itself , that of reducing taxation on employment and taxing pollution , and that of preventing damaging tax competition , which are two of the Union &apos; s common goals , we must make it understood that the only solution is joint sovereignty between the Member States and not tax competition between these States .
the wording of Article 93 becomes all the more critical considering that , once the first wave of new states has joined the Union , it will be all the more difficult for us to progress towards qualified majority voting .
Mr Moscovici , Prime Minister Jospin had the extremely good idea of enlisting the aid of a economic analysis committee .
this committee has just produced a study entitled &apos; European issues &apos; .
if you read through this study , you will see that the conclusions it comes to on taxation policy issues are the very ones that I have just set out .
Madam President , this Chamber has seen many hypocritical speeches today , as many of our number are convinced that nothing actually happened at Biarritz , apart from the obvious fact it was raining , which we would all agree upon .
it was a wasted opportunity , first and foremost with regard to the expected institutional reforms .
everyone knows that nothing will come out of the nice Summit , because there is too much disagreement between the various governments of Europe .
it was also a wasted opportunity for the Europe of fundamental rights , which was supposed to be a beacon for the world .
indeed , the Charter falls some way short of the texts already in force .
it even constitutes a step backwards in social matters in that it fails to recognise the right to employment or to a minimum wage , the right to retirement , to housing , or to abortion .
it ranks social marginalisation in the category of assistance , and not in that of fundamental rights that are binding on employers or on States .
in reality , it once again proves that this Europe is being constructed against the interests of its peoples , and this is what tens of thousands of protesters will be saying in nice on 6 and 7 December , and I hope that many of us will be there with them .
in the second that remains , and since we are talking about fundamental rights , I would like to express my indignation at the silence and complicity of most of the Member States and institutions with regard to the ongoing massacre of the Palestinian people , with whom we should be showing a little more solidarity .
Madam President , let us be clear about one matter : the single greatest challenge facing the Union is the reform of the EU institutions so that the enlargement process can take place .
we all know that enlargement of the Union cannot take place until decision-making procedures within the key institutions are reformed ; however , such a reform process must be fair and balanced .
it must protect the position of smaller Member States within the Union .
it must also protect cultural , linguistic and national diversities .
it is clear from the debates that have been taking place across Europe , including those in Biarritz , that larger Member States are seeking , in part , to bully smaller Member States to reform the European Union in line with the direction taken by larger Member States and in accordance with their wishes .
this is an unacceptable situation .
let us reflect for a moment on the ratification procedure for any newly revised European Union treaty .
it is constitutionally imperative for a referendum to be held in Denmark , Portugal and Ireland before any treaty can come into force .
if the European Treaty accepted at nice completely dilutes the influence and representation of smaller Member States , it is going to be very difficult to sell it and secure approval for it in referendums in these three countries .
decision-makers within the governments of the larger Member States should remember that seeking the approval of the citizens in a referendum is not a mere technicality or a rubber-stamp operation .
one has to convince the citizens in these countries of the clear merits of any new European treaty .
it must strike the balance between ensuring that the enlargement process can proceed and ensuring that smaller Member States retain a strong voice in the decision-making procedures of the European Union .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the informal Council meeting at Biarritz raised hopes that in-depth consideration would be given to the preparation of the nice summit , which is to lead on to the reform of the European institutions .
above and beyond this bitter admission , this Europe so often promised , which seeks to be close to and receptive to the peoples of Europe , would actually seem to me to be moving further away from this goal .
is wanting to get involved with everything and everyone , beginning with what is happening outside our border - when even the United Nations , whose task this actually is , cannot successfully do this - not a negation of this Europe which is supposed to be closer to the citizens ?
we would like to see similar zeal for action in the field when there are disasters in Europe , such as the storms of December 1999 or the sinking of the Erika .
one might wonder whether such an approach is relevant in terms of coming up with real solutions .
as is the case at every summit , the newspapers reported on the hope and anguish raised by this summit , the prelude to the Treaty of nice .
our debate today also has the same ring to it .
the negotiators see the fact that there are malcontents on both sides as proof that they are on the way to striking the right balance .
but in the end , as Commissioner Barnier has said , the aim is not to enhance the lives of our fellow citizens but to ensure the survival of the Community structure .
four revisions in fifteen years have not improved matters , and now we are expected to believe that a charter or a constitution might do something to change things .
on this basis , how can the Community act as a diplomatic entity on the international stage ?
in conclusion , let us begin to do together those things that we can do well or better in line with our peoples &apos; wishes .
then and only then will it be time to deal with everything else .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , on the subject of the situation in the Middle East , two months ago this House was unanimous in praising the commitment to peace shown by Avraham Burg , the speaker of the Knesset , and Ahmad Qurie , the President of the Palestinian legislative Council .
since then , those who preach hatred and advocate violence seem once again to have won the day .
we would be failing to understand the origins of this crisis if we imagined that fears which have reigned for generations were to give way to lasting peace , a prelude to reconciliation , without further ado .
if the European Union is to continue harbouring the ambition of playing a part in securing this peace , as is its vocation , it must first of all keep its head , and then bring all its weight to bear to facilitate the task of the decision-makers of that region who are firmly resolved to move towards peace .
first we have to keep our heads , which means that amid all the emotion and horror it is not our job to castigate one side or the other .
then bring all our weight to bear , which means that the Union must speak with a single voice , which unfortunately was not the case last week at the tenth extraordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly .
bringing all its weight to bear also implies not contenting ourselves with advocating a renewal or intensification of economic aid under the pretext that only by raising the standard of living in the region will we be able to help establish a lasting peace .
such a solution would only have an impact in the long term . faced with the emergency situation that now exists there , this is clearly no longer sufficient .
we are well aware that Jerusalem is the nub of the issue .
well , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , since the High Representative is now participating in the negotiations , which is something we all welcome , I would ask you whether the time has not come for a powerful initiative from the European Union , which might offer its services to both sides in order to arrive at a status for Jerusalem that both find acceptable and , why not , to ensure that this is enforced .
Mr President , with just seven weeks to go to the nice summit , the time has come for clarity and open debate .
how do things stand at present ?
we still have no agreement on the modus operandi for the European Commission , on how votes are to be weighted in the Council , on what should be done about the principle of qualified majority voting or on proportional representation in the European Parliament .
in other words , today - I repeat , today - there is a risk of the so-called Amsterdam left-overs becoming nice left-overs unless we take some decisive action right away .
and that is not all . the future of the Charter of Human Rights appears to be in the balance , even as an insert under Article 6 , as suggested by the European Parliament at today &apos; s sitting , as does the institutional fate of support for European political parties .
clearly the constitutionalisation of the Treaties will have to be postponed to a later date .
there are , of course , some issues on which progress of a sort is being made .
the first is reinforced cooperation , where significant progress has been made .
of course it is , on occasions , clear from the debate that this institution is viewed in some quarters not as the answer to the flexibility which Europe needs but as a sort of future defence to safeguard their interests vis-√†-vis future members of the European Union .
progress has also been made with Article 7 on combating violations of the basic values of the European Union .
so what are the deeper historical implications of these developments ?
my purpose in listing them is not to disappoint , but because we still have time to act before nice .
the leaders of Europe have not formulated a clear vision .
they have not clearly formulated their final philosophy .
sometimes the intergovernmental conference looks like an anxious administrative bureaucracy trying to share out power .
this does not convince the man in the street .
we are not managing a bank or a shop .
we are leading people and that calls for a slightly different approach .
enlargement has turned from a dream into a nightmare for some people , who fear that it might upset the balance of power .
but we are unlikely to achieve the desired result with a purely bureaucratic approach .
I am also worried by the minimum response to Parliament &apos; s call for democratisation .
I am worried that the changeover to qualified majority voting is not directly linked to codecision with the European Parliament .
but we still have time , miracles do happen in politics and I personally am keen to see a few happen in nice .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I am extremely concerned that this affair of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have a negative effect on public opinion .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been accepted in its entirety by the informal Biarritz Council .
Parliament has called unanimously upon the Summit to decide now whether to include the Charter in the Treaties . however , it is no simple matter , it is not easy to accept that the Community institutions which believe in this Charter can then hold back from giving it legal effect .
it is a sign which could contribute to turning the public increasingly against the European project , as , sadly , is already happening even in the candidate countries .
the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has decided on a method and a timetable which mean that the inclusion of the Charter in the Treaties is a decisive step towards the constitutionalisation of the Union .
therefore , the Council must stop making excuses and express an opinion .
a further point is the Commission reforms .
it would be short-sighted to envisage a Commission structured according to criteria based on the representation of the individual States .
until we are able to feel that each Commissioner represents all the citizens , irrespective of his or her nationality , we will not be genuinely united in our project .
I reiterate once again that closer cooperation must be treated as a means of harmonising differences and , therefore , of strengthening the Community spirit , and not as a means of division . nevertheless , if it is to be effective , cooperation must not be choked by constraints .
Mr President , there are many important issues which must be solved .
the Biarritz and nice Summits might nonetheless be described as a battle between those who want to build the &apos; EU State &apos; quickly and those who see the EU as a form of intergovernmental cooperation and as a unique form of Community decision-making .
what is really worrying , however , is that what might be called a form of blackmail is being perpetrated against those who , when it comes to reforms , do not wish to go further than they have been authorised to do by the Member States .
they are often accused in the press of delaying or even preventing enlargement towards the East .
it is , rather , those who are demanding extensive reforms prior to enlargement who are guilty of that .
what is needed is to act responsibly now and , in nice , to concentrate on resolving the issues left over from Amsterdam : let every country have a Commissioner .
Re-weight the votes in the Council , but not in accordance with the principle of double majorities .
stop the formation of a permanent vanguard of core Member States to lead the development process and instead respect all Member States .
the fact that people are not to be given the opportunity successfully to keep track of developments is worrying , as is the fact that there are those who oppose a genuine principle of transparency , something which is absolutely basic to democracy .
nor should we miss the chance of lending legitimacy to the Charter , which can be done by involving the people .
I am glad to see that the Swedish Presidency will be contributing to this .
Mr President , at the Biarritz Summit , there was obvious antagonism between the smaller and the larger Member States .
if they were to be complied with , the large countries &apos; demands for increased power in the Council and Parliament would upset the whole balance within the EU and mean that the small countries would have to pay for the whole cost of enlargement .
a Union of this kind would be centralised in character and give the small countries less influence than that which the United States &apos; s two-chamber system gives to small federal states .
nor would the Union become more efficient .
instead , all Member States must be prepared , upon enlargement , to surrender a proportionate amount of influence .
in Sweden , supporters of the European Union have always justified EU membership by saying that it would give us influence .
now , the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have .
I should also like to say that there is something remarkable about the fact that France , as the country holding the Presidency , consistently uses its position to promote its own national interests .
Mr President , in our plenary sitting in September we experienced and shared moments of optimism and hope with Abraham Burg , speaker of the Knesset , and Ahmed Qurie , President of the Palestinian legislative Council .
a month and a half later , what we are now sharing is great concern over the way events are developing .
on the one hand , there is the decision by the head of the Israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition , Mr Sharon .
on the other , there is the feeling that paramilitary militias and fundamentalist agitators have taken over the streets and taken the initiative in the territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority .
what is certain is that it is in difficult times such as these that the historic stature of political leaders is measured .
right now , Mr Barak and Mr Arafat must make their people understand that it is only through dialogue at a negotiating table , with painful concessions on both sides , that the conflict can be definitively resolved .
the international community , and in particular the European Union , must persevere with their efforts to avoid a confrontation which would , moreover , constitute an extremely serious source of global instability .
from a European perspective , for the first time since the Madrid conference , the European flag has been on the table in the peace process .
the unity of action at a given moment has made it possible for the work and prestige of one of the Member States in this area to be used to the benefit of all .
and while we are immersed in the institutional debate we could ask the European Commission to show creativity and political decisiveness in order to make progress in our integration in the second pillar as well .
does the French Presidency not agree ?
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would like to say a few words on the subject of the Middle East and Yugoslavia , also in connection with contributions from previous speakers .
the dramatic developments in the Middle East have of course caused a huge backlash and emotions among the European public and here in Parliament have inevitably run high in the wake of the violence of the past few days and the large number of victims - and rightly so .
following the summit meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh where all parties involved were present in order to find a way to freeze the violence and to re-open the dialogue between Barak and Arafat , we established that it is very difficult - even if , for a fleeting moment , it seemed as if it were possible - to halt the violence .
at the moment , it appears that the voice on the streets is stronger than the will for peace .
nevertheless , we all know that there are huge numbers of citizens , both in Israel and in Palestine , who are simply finding out - in the hope of peace - how tough life is as long as peace has not really been established .
that is why we back Mr Galeote and Mr Morillon in saying that it is up to us , as the European Union , to do our bit in order to give peace a chance .
we have had the protagonists , namely the speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian legislative Council , in our midst .
that was at a time when the spirit of Oslo and the spirit of Camp David were alive , even if Camp David had just collapsed , it was , so close to peace , nevertheless alive .
this is not the case today , but we did witness that the Arab leaders have been willing to show restraint .
we have witnessed that Mr Solana has managed to secure a stronger position in the peace process on our behalf .
I believe it is right that today , we once again have a joint resolution before us from all parties in which we recognise - with due consideration for maintaining an equilibrium - that both parties must restore the peace ; we as nations cannot do that .
but we need to make every effort to give them international support in order to give them that opportunity . this message could also be conveyed by the French Presidency .
we would also like to ask the French Presidency to re-deploy the entire Mediterranean-European partnership as an instrument in the forthcoming ministerial meeting in Marseilles .
for dialogue in the region must of course be held on a wider platform and if all players take part , there is a chance that both nations will find a way to peace from within .
the other point I wanted to raise is the topic of Yugoslavia .
needless to say , we in this Parliament can only rejoice at the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica as President .
it was a choice in favour of democracy .
it was a choice for Europe .
the sanctions have been lifted .
the European Agency for Reconstruction has been deployed and so has the cards programme .
the Humanitarian programme has been extended to include refugees and other people who have been driven out of their homes .
the Republic is being given the opportunity to take part in the stability and association process .
it is also being given the chance to participate in the stability pact and , along with this , to establish contact with their counterparts in the neighbouring countries , to recognise the sovereignty and , as such , to pave the way for a democratic process .
we believe that the democratic process within Yugoslavia can only be viable if it is also respectful towards the neighbouring countries , and recognises their sovereignty too .
it was a good , major step forward to make those EUR 200 million available for the Federal Republic .
at the same time , we would ask the Council to operate in the same spirit during the budget negotiations for 2001 .
for without adjusting the perspective in chapter IV , we will simply allow Africa or Asia to foot the bill once again for something we should attempt to set up ourselves in Yugoslavia in terms of democratic values .
let us apply the same generosity of spirit which you , the Council , have shown this year with regard to 2001 .
in the Group of the Party of European Socialists , we therefore urge you to apply the spirit which you managed to apply previously in the budget negotiations , to the budget negotiations for 2001 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I regret that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has not remained in the Chamber after pointing the finger at the political force which I represent .
clearly , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has been misinformed regarding Italy and my party .
I must make it clear once and for all that Forza Italia has never opposed the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the members of Forza Italia voted for the Charter in Europe and I am able to inform you officially that we will vote for it here in Strasbourg in November .
in the Italian Parliament , we voted for the Charter but with a different motion from that of the left-wing majority , in which we stressed the need for the Charter to provide greater protection of individual freedoms .
we are the opposition and I feel that we have the right to vote for resolutions in favour of the Charter which differ from those tabled by the majority .
I hope that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo will accept my invitation - which I hereby formally extend to him , and I hope he is listening - to come to Italy to gain direct , first-hand experience of the situation in my country , without interference from the Communist Party / Democratic Left .
I would advise Mr Bar√≥n Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain to him why they are in government in Italy with an openly Communist party and why they are preparing to go to the political elections with another openly Communist party , the Communist Refoundation Party .
and Mr Bar√≥n Crespo should also ask his Italian colleagues to account for the vehement declarations made against the Jews in Israel , declarations which throw further fuel on the fire of a spreading anti-Semitic feeling which is already too violent in Europe .
and he should also request information from the current leaders , who used to belong to the Democratic Left Party and who were leaders of the Italian Communist Party at the time when certain elements of the Communist Party helped one of the murderers of Aldo Moro &apos; s bodyguards to escape from Italy to Algeria .
I hope that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo will be able to come to Italy to discuss these points .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it is certainly to be welcomed that account was taken in Biarritz of the need for coordination in the sphere of energy policy , which is of such crucial importance to citizens , the economy , growth and prosperity .
there is really no point in Member States going it alone in this respect ; the fact that the Community is totally dependent on energy says it all .
the package of measures proposed by the Commission with a view to increasing energy efficiency and saving energy , is therefore constructive , and likewise the investigations into cartel problems with the oil companies .
it is not just the cartel of oil-producing countries we should be concentrating on though , but also that of the oil companies .
we wish the French Council Presidency every success at the negotiations in Riyadh , on which occasion , as I see it , these States would do well to ensure that oil prices do not rocket any higher , if only for reasons of self-interest .
Setbacks in economic growth within the European Union have repercussions for the global economy .
we should also take a look at our own situation , however .
it is important to take a step forward on the European energy taxation front , such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle .
with that in mind , Parliament is expecting the nice Summit to take a step in the direction of qualified majority voting in those areas where taxation policy is disrupting the proper functioning of the internal market .
Biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the European Union .
the Council Presidency wants to abolish the cooperation procedure and replace it with the consultation procedure .
this procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective .
nor is it to be tolerated with regard to Economic and Monetary Union ; on the contrary !
this is precisely where we must advance the cause of the codecision procedure .
if the project is not yet viable , then we urge the French Council Presidency to seek progressive institutional reforms and measures which will enable Parliament to participate .
at the very least , it must be possible to agree on the detail of a common position on these matters in nice .
but we say &apos; no &apos; to replacing the cooperation procedure with the consultation procedure .
that would be a retrograde step .
that is why action is called for !
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , a little while ago , you made the point that Parliament would not issue a statement on the number of seats in the European Parliament .
I would urge you just to read through the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report , in which Parliament has taken up clear positions , not only in respect of the distribution of the seats , but also on the weighting of votes in the Council and the composition of the Commission .
perhaps these positions , when read in context , will help us to extricate ourselves from the present conflict between larger and smaller States , which is paralysing the Intergovernmental Conference .
because that is one of the most serious problems we face .
we must recognise that the smaller States are on an equal footing with the larger ones in this Union of States , and that we must find other ways to redress the balance for the larger States .
we must not allow things to reach a point where the smaller States fear that there might be recourse to solutions by decree .
the increase in intergovernmental initiatives , the official demands raised , and the options discussed in connection with enhanced cooperation , are all initiatives that could ruin the truly successful nature of the European Union .
in the past , the European Union has been successful in those areas where the Monnet method and majority decision-making are applied , and where the institutions , i.e. Parliament and the Commission , have been strengthened .
this must be brought out at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , so as to avoid any misunderstandings in this respect .
to do otherwise would lead us down a blind alley .
this method , which was appropriate for 6 Members , will be all the more appropriate for 27 Members because it is not possible for the European Union to be led by a Council of Ministers that changes its chairmanship every six months , and will therefore not be in a position , once there are 27 Member States , to lend coherence to the development of the European Union .
the Commission , having the option of simple majority voting , would be better equipped to provide this impetus in the future .
for this reason , Mr President , I would urge you to push for the Monnet approach at the next Intergovernmental Conference , together with qualified majority voting , and in so doing , to make the Union fit for enlargement .
Mr President , in this debate on the informal summit in Biarritz , I would like to focus on the IGC and the Charter .
concerning the IGC , I would like to highlight three points .
firstly , the issue of majority decision-making .
as I understand it , the French Presidency has presented 45 articles and topics with regard to majority decision-making .
this is looking reasonably promising , provided that this number is not cut down to 35 or 40 topics in nice .
but of particular importance is the fact that those topics which will fall under the scope of qualified majority will also fall under the scope of codecision with the European Parliament , and this issue does not appear to be an open-and-shut case .
indeed , if this does not happen , both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will be sidelined , and the democratic rift will widen rather than narrow . surely that is the last thing we want .
secondly , the issue of the number of Commissioners .
like Mr Brok , I would like to stress here once again that one Commissioner per Member State is absolutely vital to give each country a place in the European executive .
as for the number of MEPs , nobody is in favour of more than 700 .
would it then not be useful to work on the basis of the new numbers during the next elections in 2004 ?
if new Member States then join , the new numbers can be applied and we will automatically remain under the 700 mark , for if we overstep the mark once , I do not think we can go back .
and finally , the Charter .
I gather that the document was well-received at Biarritz and that it can be adopted following a number of legal clarifications and subject to an official declaration at the Summit in nice , to be incorporated at a later stage in the Treaties .
in my opinion , the Convention did sterling work and I am proud to have been part of this Convention .
the sooner the document can be incorporated in the Treaties , the better , because in that way , the Treaties will gain a constitutional dimension and the citizens will be drawn closer to Europe , because it will mean that a piece of legislation specifically for their benefit has got off the ground .
however , we have to express our concern that there were cries of defiance in certain matters .
the impression that spread to the citizens of Europe via the media was that there was conflict between the small and large countries .
the Union cannot develop as a Community of 27 members if we cling to the notion that it is mainly a system of intergovernmental cooperation in which the Union &apos; s bodies are merely responsible for implementation or control matters in a very loose way .
already there are numerous examples of how just one country can obstruct matters which almost all countries consider to be important .
it is the large countries just as much as the small that bear the responsibility for this sort of thing .
examples include the European company , the pan-European liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services , which is stumbling along , the opening-up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation .
a cautionary example of inappropriate behaviour is offered surprisingly by Austria , which has just experienced unjust treatment itself , as that country is warning its neighbour , the Czech Republic , against using its nuclear power plant at Temelin .
the Union does not now need visionaries with tunnel vision leading up to the year 2030 , but problem-solvers that can see the problems that enlargement over the next 3 to 8 years will bring with it , and see the solutions to them .
solutions have to be found within the circle of the Union &apos; s institutions through the discovery of a more flexible approach , if necessary by empowering part of the Union to engage in more essential cooperation , by strengthening the position of the Commission , and by switching in the main to a system of qualified majority decisions .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights proudly conveys what European values are , but it is fruitless to create an artificial controversy with regard to its rapid and binding constitutionality .
in this too it is time which must bring decisions to maturity , for example , among ourselves in the Nordic countries .
thank you , Mr President . I would like to make some brief comments to set the seal on this debate , but first want to thank each of the speakers , to whom I have listened very attentively , for the quality of their interventions and their candour .
to put it briefly , everybody has touched on the &apos; larger states and smaller states &apos; debate , and I would like to join Mr Moscovici in saying that I feel that this is an inappropriate way of describing the division that exists .
it is not that we are unaware of this division or act as if it did not exist .
I simply feel that we have to move beyond and rise above it by means of proposals that ensure a more efficient functioning of the Community model in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome .
on an issue that I regard as critical - that of the Commission itself - I have heard Mr Van den Bos echo the concerns of Mr Poettering regarding the place that is to be occupied by one or other country within the Commission .
ladies and gentlemen , none of the options that are on the table would entail a country &apos; losing its Commissioner &apos; , even if I feel that this to be an inappropriate description if one recalls that the Commission is an independent body .
under every option , each country will have at least one Commissioner .
the question we must answer is whether all the countries will have a Commissioner at the same time , and thus whether we are to have a big - and one day a very big - Commission that will inevitably have been restructured , or if they are all to have one Commissioner but not necessarily at the same time .
in the latter case , the question we must answer is when will this principle of a rotation which treats both larger and smaller states on a strictly equal basis come into effect .
each option has significant consequences .
a further word on the Charter . the Commission has been an active participant in the open discussions entered into via the Convention .
I am thinking in particular of my friend and fellow Commissioner , Antonio Vitorino , who was very active throughout these discussions .
I would point out that right from the start the Commission indicated that it was in favour of the idea of giving legal effect to this Charter .
personally speaking , I feel that the minimum could be , to echo what Mr M√©ndez de Vigo and Mrs Ber√®s have said , a link with Article 6 of the Treaty , which could be established as soon as nice .
I nevertheless feel that we cannot stop there and that we must take things further after nice .
Mr Berthu talked about this Charter as if it were a thunderbolt that had dropped out of the sky .
all the same , we did make reference to the intelligent and open work that culminated in this Charter , in which national parliaments representing national opinions participated .
the national governments participated fully and have all approved this text .
we are thus talking about an open piece of work which has not fallen from on high or been imposed from above .
that is why in the final analysis it has met with general approval .
both Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Bar√≥n Crespo have mentioned the European Parliament .
I would like , in my turn , to confirm that we will be talking about Parliament during these negotiations .
it is one of the points that have been broached in the discussions and I honestly feel that , beyond what we are able to achieve in the negotiations themselves , anything that the European Parliament itself can quite clearly say on the way it is to be structured after enlargement will be very useful to us because it will enlighten our work and the work of the Member States .
finally , a word on the Biarritz spirit or climate : Mr Dupuis has surely misunderstood what I said .
I am not of aware of having shown myself to be overoptimistic .
in any case , I spoke of purpose and determination .
I do not yet know whether we will achieve real reform at nice , and one sufficient for a Union that has 27 Member States and quite clearly may subsequently have many more , provided that the democratic process in the Balkans is consolidated and strengthened .
in any event , the Commission has its place and is striving to secure genuine reform .
I simply said , Mr Dupuis , that success or failure , genuine reform or inadequate reform , would be assessed on the basis of whether the Community model - which does indeed , Mr Moscovici comprise the three institutions you mentioned , but others too - would emerge from nice weakened , intact or strengthened .
we are striving to strengthen it , and this is a way of allaying the concerns of many Member States , and not just the smaller Member States , on the place and the role that they will occupy within this Community model .
I have specifically mentioned some of the factors that will enable us to ascertain immediately whether the reform is sufficient or not .
the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to real issues , the preservation of Article 250 in its current form , the place and role of the Commission in closer cooperation , in respect of more than just the first pillar : these are some of the factors that will allow us see straight away whether we are talking of success or failure .
on this point I must make it quite clear that I totally agree with what Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos have just said .
lastly , as Mr Bar√≥n Crespo and Mr Poettering have just suggested , I believe that we must indeed raise the debate to the political level and the correct level , that of the final decision , which is to say the level of Heads of State and Government .
I am personally very pleased that the discussions at Biarritz were marked by the desire to come up with genuine reform .
this was my impression at least .
my interpretation of the climate and the weather at Biarritz might well have differed from that of Mr Moscovici , who doubtless knows the Pyrenees better than I do . it was cloudy and it was windy , but what I really wanted to emphasise was the tone of the debates , and their invigorating and purposeful nature .
this was what struck me personally , and gives me some confidence that there will be genuine results at nice .
finally , I would like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for her intervention .
I can reassure her and state that we , like the Presidency , are determined to press ahead on the basis of the proposals made by Mrs de Palacio concerning European energy policy in the areas of reserves and conservation and support for renewable sources of energy , not least during the negotiations which we have just been talking about in the context of the IGC on the extension of qualified majority voting in environmental matters .
the Commission is striving to make progress , is doing its job , on all these issues . I know that in this matter , just as in the matter of maritime safety which I mentioned earlier , which was discussed at some length at the nice European Council , we can count on the resolve of the current French Presidency of the Union .
that concludes the debate .
I have received seven motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the vote will be taken on Wednesday .
Constitutionalisation of the Treaties - reinforced cooperation - island status
the next item is the joint debate on the :
report ( A5-0289 / 2000 ) by Mr Duhamel , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on constitutionalisation of the Treaties ( 2000 / 2160 ( INI ) ) ;
report ( A5-0288 / 2000 ) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on reinforced cooperation ( 2000 / 2162 ( INI ) ) ;
oral Question to the Council ( B5-0542 / 2000 ) pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure , by Mr Napolitano , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on Article 158 of the EC Treaty concerning island status ;
oral Question to the Commission ( B5-0543 / 2000 ) pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure , by Mr Napolitano , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on Article 158 of the EC Treaty concerning island status .
my thanks go to everyone from Jo and Giorgio to I√±igo , from Dany to Frassoni , from Richard to Elmar , from Bayrou to Andrew .
thanks to you all , a new idea is gaining ground on the continent of Europe : the idea of a European Constitution .
the concept of a constitution is a new idea for Europe , while at the same time a very old idea , dating back to the origins of the modern age and connecting us with the most profound debates on democracy .
to the right of us , we have Joseph de Maistre , the counter-revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of a constitution , because a constitution is made - shock , horror ! - by man and - surprise , surprise - for man .
&quot; but man does not exist &quot; , he said , specifying that he had met many a Spaniard or a Frenchman and even perhaps a Persian , but &quot; I have never met man .
if he does exist , it has escaped my notice &quot; .
to the left of us , we have Karl Marx , the revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights , because , in his view , the human does not exist in the abstract , and humanity could not constitute anything at all .
at the beginning of the twenty-first century , criticisms of these two kinds are still being levelled and , sometimes , there is nothing to separate the two .
nor , sometimes , is there any difference between the crimes and acts of inhumanity committed by men in denial of other persons &apos; dignity .
the lessons we have learnt from the twentieth century , however , is if we see people everywhere only as French , Germans , Danish , Irish , Arabs , Hutus , Tutsis , Serbs , Bosnians and Persians , we end up forgetting our common humanity .
without this fundamental point of reference , at best there is mutual lack of understanding and at worst there is mutual killing .
the British and the Irish , the Serbs and the Croats , the Israelis and the Palestinians , the peoples on both sides can only exist if , as a precondition , human beings exist .
taking away their humanity to leave only their nationality is to take away the person . then they are lost .
they cannot accept the other as being the same .
all they see is the enemy , and they destroy each other .
as you know , the European Community was born out of rejection of this destruction .
we have managed to avoid war for fifty-five years !
Strasbourg is a place that appreciates the importance of this record .
this achievement within the Western half of Europe is something we wish to extend to the whole continent .
enlargement will guarantee this .
with peace guaranteed , Western Europe has started to attend to business in search of prosperity .
let us not criticise commercial Europe too much , I speak as a Socialist : it provides greater wealth to all of us .
yet the European Union should not be described as just one large marketplace , it has other purposes as declared in the Treaties : European integration , freedom , democracy , human rights , the rule of law , fundamental social rights .
peace , prosperity , democracy and justice are values which , each in their own way , virtually all the Members and the groups in Parliament , and the majority of elected representatives and political groups wish to see achieved by Europe and for Europe .
democracy in Europe is in better health .
thirty years ago , great countries in the South of Europe lived under dictatorship , and Eastern Europe was subsisting under the yoke of the Soviet Union .
today , we have just experienced one of the last democratic revolutions in Europe , that of October 2000 in Serbia .
we feel sure that , very soon , we will be joined by a democratic Serbia .
what better evidence of the European Union than this association between the victory of democracy and entry into the great family of the Community !
democracy in Europe is in good health , but European democracy is in a bad way .
one in two European citizens did not vote in the elections of June 1999 .
it is not something that we are about to forget .
one in two of my students does not know who Romano Prodi is , although they are almost all quite clear on Michael Schumacher or Monica Lewinsky .
that tells us something about how far politics in general have decayed , and just how distant the European institutions are from the citizens of Europe .
some resign themselves to this state of affairs , and others are delighted at it , but not us .
that is why we want to see European democracy being strengthened by a European constitution .
what do we actually have right now ?
we seem to have almost everything , yet in the finally analysis we have nothing .
seven Treaties , hundreds of articles , an impossible tangle of standards , Preferences , regulations , procedures , core legislation and secondary legislation .
the European Constitution does exist but no one has ever found it .
it remains undiscovered , invisible , illegible and unintelligible .
we want a proper constitution .
let us at least agree on this objective , and if we do agree , then let us state how to achieve it .
Parliament is proposing one route involving two phases , two stops : reorganisation of the Treaties , the fast track , and adoption of a constitution , the gradual track .
the report proposes these two phases as commitments that should be entered into at nice , because it is possible .
it also states that before being completed , there should be a European referendum , because it is a dream which we need .
at all events , do not kill it off today .
if we want to achieve it , then we can , all together , citizens , Members of Parliament , and governments of the European Union .
today , the 24 October 2000 , in Strasbourg , the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly : the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want .
Mr President , the issue I wish to discuss is far more specific , even though it must be said that some of us consider reinforced cooperation to be the panacea to combat the hypothetical freezing of the European integration process , supposedly inevitable due to the increase in the number of Member States following the next round of enlargement .
some would consider this to be the equivalent of throwing a lifebelt to enable certain states to survive the shipwreck of Community construction , and to others it involves creating a hard core of supposedly elite countries , or patanegra states , as we would say in Spanish , states that would , by virtue of their power , cohesion and weight , act as a veritable Cabinet .
there are also , Mr President , those who see reinforced cooperation as the ideal instrument with which to create an &quot; √† la carte Europe &quot; or a &quot; variable geometry Europe &quot; , in which Community solidarity and cohesion would be diluted in a range of various intergovernmental cooperation schemes .
this would be a Europe that is neither democratic , nor efficient , nor transparent , but simply a self-service organisation .
none of these approaches seems acceptable or realistic to me .
my report therefore simply suggests making the existing provisions more flexible by following clear and coherent criteria :
first , we must establish cooperation within the Community framework and not in parallel intergovernmental operations .
Europe cannot be brought closer to the citizens by making its structure more and more complicated .
second , we must maintain the unity of Parliament and the Commission and increase their participation in both establishing and developing reinforced cooperation .
the experience of the Maastricht Social Protocol and of Economic and Monetary Union show that the participation of all the members of these Institutions is technically feasible and politically advisable , and preserves the coherence of the system and the participation of all European citizens in decisions that affect them all the time .
Dividing up legislative and executive powers or replacing them with a greater number of bodies , secretariats , parallel chambers and the like does not lead to democracy but to inefficiency .
third , we must increase the scope of reinforced cooperation to include the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy , which in the last few years have been crying out for a Community channel to avoid the dispersion , slowness and inefficiency that end up transferring decisions and the task of solving specifically European problems to the United States of America .
fourth , we must eliminate the veto and reduce the minimum number of Member States required to set in motion Community reinforced cooperation .
I say &quot; Community &quot; , ladies and gentlemen , because this is what we are talking about , making Community instruments more powerful instead of replacing them .
the dividing line between those who want a political Europe and those who want to reduce it to a market lies in strengthening the Community rather than intergovernmental operations , and not the opposite , as the President of the Commission explained quite recently in this Assembly .
we do not need a Europe with divergent objectives , but a Europe with a common objective , albeit with various speeds .
finally , we need reinforced cooperation that is open , not closed , and which includes rather than excludes those current or future members that do not sign up immediately - a form of reinforced cooperation that acts as an impetus instead of creating further obstacles .
Mr President , I have had the satisfaction of noting that the proposals presented recently at the Intergovernmental Conference coincide in the main with all or some of the criteria I have set out .
I hope that the spirit of Biarritz that we have talked about so much today will materialise , as spirits that do not materialise become ghosts and the attic of European construction is full of such ghosts .
finally , I must thank the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its chairman for the kindness with which they received my report , the contributions which enabled me to improve it and the tremendous support that was given in the final vote .
with this support , Mr President , and in the hope that our resolution will be useful in this final , decisive stage of the Intergovernmental Conference , I ask the House to vote for this report .
Mr President , I am outlining here a resolution which was approved and discussed last week by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank the Chairman , Mr Napolitano , who conducted the proceedings and signed the resolution .
this resolution draws the attention of the Community organs and the forthcoming nice Intergovernmental Conference to the issue of the islands , of island status , or rather the principle that island status as such should be recognised as one of the criteria for Community intervention because of the actual conditions which any form of island status involves for the regions concerned .
anyone who has studied the issue is aware of the mystery of the translations : while the Italian version adopts the principle that island status is one of the valid criteria for Community intervention , the French and other translations express a different concept and the English translation is ambiguous and could be interpreted in either way .
I will not focus on the linguistic issue but I will restrict myself to pointing out - because it is an important , historic fact - that the official version drawn up by the Intergovernmental Conference of Amsterdam , which was , moreover , in French , is identical to the current Italian text .
it expresses the idea , that is , that island status is in itself an adequate criterion .
in effect , the text which was officially issued by the Intergovernmental Conference - which I will pass on to Commissioner Barnier and to the Minister , should your legal offices not have already done so - clearly shows that this was the opinion actually issued by the Intergovernmental Conference but that it was mistranslated into other languages .
I will not continue for there are more powerful arguments than the linguistic argument .
there are sections of the Treaties which establish the principle of cohesion and there is Declaration 30 which , in affirming and applying the principle of cohesion in this context , reads , and I quote the exact wording : &quot; the Conference recognises that island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status , the permanence of which impairs their social and economic development &quot; .
it is not , therefore , on the basis of a number of languages or a number of translations , but on the basis of a fundamental principle of the charters , of the Treaties , that is , the principle of cohesion , that we call for the islands to be recognised as such , as the possible beneficiaries of specific interventions and specific attention .
Commissioner , Mr President , we are not begging : we are simply asking the Community to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the other citizens , not privileged citizens .
if Europe wants to be something more than merely the scene of the globalisation battle , if it wants to be a complete Community , moving , united in all its components and expressions , towards new progress and new civilisation , we call upon you , not to give us more than the others but to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the others .
we are not asking for anything specific or tangible ; we are not asking for funding : we are simply calling for this principle of island status to be universally accepted , so that the citizens of the European Union can all start the race on an equal footing , with equal chances of reaching the finish line .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteurs , ladies and gentlemen of the House , you wanted us to have a debate , this morning , on those issues regarding which this House thought it necessary to add to the opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that was issued in April .
initially , you planned three reports : constitutionalisation of the Treaties , reinforced cooperation , and the ceiling on the number of Members of the European Parliament .
I note , at any rate , that for today , the last matter has not been referred to us , and I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Barnier .
the Presidency takes note of this , but the situation must be noted .
it is one we regret .
who better than this House to give an informed opinion on this issue of major importance in view of the imminent enlargement ?
finally , one last point of a quite different sort , which Mr Segni , backed by Chairman Napolitano , wished to bring up , and which I noted , the question of islands .
I shall now return to each of these points , but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate .
with your permission , I shall begin - and I would ask Olivier Duhamel not to hold it against me , I am not overlooking him - with the issue of reinforced cooperation which is actually on the agenda for the IGC , unlike the issue of constitutionalisation , which will come afterwards .
let me go to the heart of the matter , focussing on the salient points of Mr Gil-Robles &apos; report , which I shall simply describe as excellent in my view .
this is a point I already made in presenting the results of the informal Council meeting in Biarritz .
I think it is safe to say that the conclusions of your rapporteur - as indeed he noted - for the most part echo the concerns expressed by the Member States in Biarritz .
first of all , Mr Chairman , I note your agreement as to the reasons justifying making this mechanism more flexible so than it can be properly implemented within an enlarged Europe .
I note your concern that the institutional framework of the Union be respected and the need to design an accessible instrument , as well as your wish to eliminate the veto within the Council . all these are principles which met with general approval in Biarritz .
I also understand your determination to prevent any interference with what you term the &apos; institutional indivisibility &apos; of the European Parliament or the Commission .
we are , once again , all agreed that the institutional framework of the European Union should be respected .
there is no case for going beyond the Treaties or challenging the existing framework .
nonetheless , we have here a special instrument of an exceptional nature which is , of necessity , somewhat specific in relation to the civil law .
let me stress that there is absolutely no question of using this instrument in order to compensate for failing to introduce qualified majority voting in some areas .
qualified majority voting is indeed the prime objective at the Intergovernmental Conference .
nor is there any question of creating an √† la carte Europe .
however , in spite of the clear guarantees which must surround reinforced cooperation , such cooperation is nonetheless exceptional in nature , and shows that it was not possible , at a given time , for the fifteen Member States to come to an agreement on stepping up cooperation in a specific sector .
hence , it will not be easy to say that everything is going ahead just as if the fifteen Member States were involved , if you will forgive me belabouring such an obvious point .
and so , while respecting the existing constitutional framework , I must say I think it would be difficult to envisage more than a procedure for an advisory opinion from Parliament when such measures are adopted .
as for the arrangements for implementing reinforced cooperation , these present another , more complex problem .
in such circumstances , what legitimacy would Parliament &apos; s vote have , if expressed by a majority of Members of Parliament representing States that were not involved in such reinforced cooperation ?
would this not be another way of reintroducing , by the back door , the veto which you yourselves wanted us to get rid of ?
objectively speaking , this is a real matter of principle which makes it impossible , in my view , to adopt exactly the same rules within each area of reinforced cooperation as within the European Union , and this is all the more true in the very specific and delicate area of foreign security and defence policy .
I think we must clearly keep in mind what specific situations this arrangement is intended to deal with .
it must not become the norm , and it must be given a degree of flexibility , within the limits of a number of principles .
I now come to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties .
I could confine myself to thanking Mr Duhamel , and to simply pointing out that his text contains a quite unwarranted attack on President Prodi - his were , of course , humorous comments - or even observing that he has not said exactly how he wants this constitution to be arrived at .
fortunately , his report is available , and the term &apos; constitution &apos; unites , or covers , a number of requirements .
firstly , simplification and clarification of the Treaties .
next , the creation of a proper reference text clearly establishing the principles and objectives of the European Union and , finally , the distribution of competences between the various decision-making levels within the European Union .
this is a question which Parliament , to give credit where it is due , asked very early in the day , as soon as it took office , in fact , in July 1999 .
it is a response to the real requirements which I have just listed .
it is also true , however , that we must as a Presidency take account of the fact that the Member States have so far indicated that they are not yet ready to discuss a constitution , even if an illustrious list of political representatives has raised the issue .
the fact is , it is easy to see why Member States are not yet at that point .
while a constitution can provide a response , at least in part , to the questions I listed , it is a project which in real terms goes a lot farther than that .
a constitution , by definition , is a fundamental act of immense political scope , in the best sense of the term .
it cannot be seen as simply an exercise in tidying up the wording or even in assigning competences .
in my opinion , a constitution goes a lot farther than that , and this future development , the precise shape of our future in Europe , is something that we have not yet clearly decided between ourselves .
I feel we cannot talk properly about a constitution and plan ways to draw it up until we know what we want to put in it .
as you know full well , that presupposes our taking certain political decisions , with a scope that goes much farther than meeting the three requirements which I have just mentioned .
I note , moreover , that among the Heads of State and Government who did declare an opinion on this , not all were equally as approving of the idea , far from it .
let me come back to the three matters I mentioned .
firstly , simplification of the Treaties .
yes , it is a laudable objective , and some brilliant legal minds have tried their hand at it .
Treaties are not rewritten without affecting existing legislation .
that is understandable .
it is extremely difficult to rewrite treaties which have been negotiated , sometimes down to the last comma , and the next item in our debate provides an eloquent example of this .
next , there is - and once again it is inevitable , yet questionable - an element of randomness , which is understandable , in the decisions made by the European institute of Florence .
I am thinking , for instance , of the way in which the authors of the report attach equal importance to each of the common policies , even though their respective importance is obviously very different , and this is expressed by provisions which are also very different in nature .
I shall not continue , as we are not here , or I , at least , am not here , to discuss the institute &apos; s report .
in any case , I noted that your rapporteur was actually proposing an alternative solution which would involve , if I understand correctly , making a distinction between , firstly , the provisions that would be part of a framework treaty and , secondly , the other provisions , particularly the common policies , which would form part of a protocol to be appended .
what I wish to suggest is that , whatever the option selected , being personally not only open but also favourable to the idea of a constitution , this approach raises fundamental questions .
this is neither a technical nor an innocuous exercise and we must ask fundamental questions before doing anything .
the second matter is the distribution of competences .
it is a question often raised , but less often debated .
there has not , to date , been any conclusive outcome to this debate , but that should certainly not deter us from making some improvements .
it is a complex exercise .
we must take care not to destroy the aspect which has made the Community so special since the very beginning , this blend , which varies according to sector , but always very subtle , of shared competences .
an exercise of this type must not upset the balance or cause us to regress , in the name of the principle of subsidiarity , as some parties seem to wish .
that is what I wanted to express at this stage .
speaking on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office , it would be inappropriate for me to say more , for as you know we have taken a decision to focus until December on the four key questions on the agenda .
we are not unaware that other questions are being raised .
a number of honourable Members have raised these questions , as have the Commission and Parliament .
Theses issues , or at least some of them , will no doubt come up for discussion very shortly .
the nice meeting is going to be held , the conclusions of that gathering will be made public , and then we will have the situation after nice .
this will not necessarily be in the form desired by your rapporteur because , as I said earlier , not all Member States will necessarily be ready , but an extremely useful contribution will have been made .
I think we will see matters more clearly in nice , and I think it is the results of the IGC - for we must not underestimate the impact that the outcome of the IGC will have on our ability to go further - which will determine whether we shall be able to look into the opportuneness of opening up new working areas and , if appropriate , of defining working methods and a work schedule .
one last brief word on the way in which a text of this type would be drawn up , when the time comes .
you rapporteur proposes adopting the method of the Convention .
why not , indeed ?
this method has , it is true , demonstrated its worth in drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
several Members of this House , but also representatives of Member States have already pointed out that the traditional method of the Intergovernmental Conference was certainly not the best method .
I myself stressed that the method adopted for the Charter was an avenue worth exploring .
do we need a Convention or do we need some other method ?
that remains to be seen , including , moreover , the process of adopting , ultimately , the future European constitution which , I am convinced , will one day come to exist .
and now , one very quick word about the island regions .
as usual , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , with its chairman , and yourself , Mr Segni , brought up questions that were both extremely pertinent but also extremely complex .
I shall attempt to respond as precisely as possible to one question . to tell the truth , I do not know the answer at the present time .
I understand that our Italian friends , for the most part , have found some discrepancies between the different language versions of Article 158 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , some shades of meaning and outright differences , which may give rise to differing interpretations .
this question was raised as early as 1997 , I believe , after the new Treaty was adopted but before it was signed .
according to the information available to the Presidency , forgive me if I have to be technical at this point , it appears that the clear majority of the language versions , unlike the Italian version , as far as the implementation of cohesion policy is concerned , refer only to the less favoured islands and not to islands in general .
it is clear , however , as you have stated so clearly , that this question is not just a matter of linguistic or semantic debate , but instead concerns an extremely important and sensitive issue , which is the handling of island issues within the European Union and the policies which may be set up and implemented within these territories .
as I said , given the lack of information available to us , I am not in a position to deliver a definitive opinion on this matter today , but the Presidency is , of course , willing to help clarify the matter by , for instance , referring the matter to the Council &apos; s legal department within the Council and even within the Intergovernmental Conference .
I think we might then have more relevant information so as to be able to clarify the matter and , at that time , to give you a comprehensive answer .
that is all the information I wished to give you .
I shall now end in order to leave the floor open for the debate .
Mr President , before I in turn discuss the two excellent reports presented by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Duhamel on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , which both have an institutional or constitutional dimension , allow me to begin this speech by responding to Mr Segni who brought up the status of the islands .
I would therefore like to assure Mr Segni that , like him , the Commission itself has noted certain discrepancies between the various language versions of Article 158 of the Treaty .
clearly , these linguistic differences are prejudicial to a clear interpretation of the text as , depending on which version you consult , either all or some of the islands could be concerned .
however , Mr Segni , I personally do not think that there can be any ambiguity as to the content , as the text of Declaration No 30 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam specifies that Community legislation must take account of the structural handicaps relating to islands and that specific measures in favour of such regions may be undertaken where justified .
island status as such is not a criterion for eligibility .
and that , I understand , is what you are lamenting .
disadvantaged islands are , of course , covered by cohesion policy .
this is the case of many islands that I visit within the scope of Objective 1 or the cohesion appropriations , due to the very fact of their socio-economic situation and in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Structural Fund general regulation .
Mr Segni , I have decided to instigate a study on the socio-economic situation of the islands , in order to assess the situation and get as precise a diagnosis as possible of these island regions and I myself will present the results of this study , which I hope will be available during the second half of 2001 .
I will say in passing that these results will complement the debate that I also intend to instigate in 2001 on the cohesion report , an important public debate in which the European Parliament will take part and which will enable me to prepare the guidelines for the future regional policy for the period 2006-2013 .
but I understand that , behind the linguistic aspect , your question expresses another concern .
with regard to this , I have told you of my intention , at least before being able to respond and if the governments agree when the time comes , to get a clearer and more objective view on the basis of the study that I am going to commission on the situation of all the islands of the various Member States of the European Union .
I would now like to discuss , in turn , the two reports presented by Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles and Olivier Duhamel .
on the report on reinforced cooperation , I must remind you that it is not a simple matter , and Mr Gil-Robles is well aware of this as he had to fight for it .
at the very beginning of the negotiations , this issue was not on the agenda .
we all fought , and I thank the Portuguese and French presidencies for coming to realise that we had to add this issue of reinforced cooperation to the notorious three leftovers from Amsterdam .
thus , on content and form , I am pleased to see , that the positions of the European Commission and the European Parliament are very close .
after this IGC , Mr Gil-Robles , I think the instrument of reinforced cooperation will be more clearly defined and , if I may use this expression , more &apos; workable &apos; in relation to the current content of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
for the Commission , there are five essential components of reinforced cooperation .
it must take place , as you said yourself , within the institutional framework , with a suitable role for each institution : that is the first point .
it must remain open to all and , as I said earlier , it must be an instrument of association , integration , and definitely not an instrument of exclusion : that is the second point .
it requires strict conditions , but also practicable conditions : that is the third point .
guarantees are needed for those not , or not yet , participating in reinforced cooperation : that is the fourth point .
finally , the fifth point : reinforced cooperation must not be seen , as is sometimes the case , as a way of concealing or hiding a lack of agreement on qualified majority .
as far as I can see , these two issues , although they are sometimes related , basically have nothing to do with each other .
I think that the report presented to you today , ladies and gentlemen , echoes these five features .
it is important to ensure that this reinforced cooperation remains within the framework of the European Union and respects the roles of the institutions , in particular the Commission and the European Parliament .
furthermore , Mr Gil-Robles , most of the delegations to the negotiations in which I am participating agree that the future treaty should recognise an enhanced role for the Commission and the Parliament in implementing reinforced cooperation .
we now need to work together to ensure that this intention or direction actually becomes reality .
I am therefore prepared to support the request in Jos√© Maria Gil ¬≠ Robles &apos; report aiming to enhance Parliament &apos; s role and I support the idea , at least , of replacing the consultation of the European Parliament in the first pillar with its assent .
however , in our opinion , the roles currently envisaged by the presidency in its very latest proposals regarding the procedure for i.e. the CFSP , are still inadequate as they stand .
that is why , yesterday , when we were discussing various points , I put forward a number of amendments which will usefully serve to specify or enhance the role of our institutions and the place allotted to them according to the pillars , in the context of implementation of reinforced cooperation .
we must ensure that the required coherence between actions under the three pillars is also strengthened , a task that will fall primarily to the Community institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , reinforced cooperation cannot , and must never allow the acquis communautaire to be unravelled in any way .
I would remind you that the procedure can be simple , with a qualified majority and the withdrawal of the veto , because we want to maintain strict conditions .
strict conditions , moreover , such as those laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , which we think must be maintained , may justify or allow for simple procedures .
I completely share Parliament &apos; s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged , but I have noticed , Mr Gil-Robles , a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible , as in point 11 of your resolution , and I would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect .
finally , we all agree that reinforced cooperation should not - I have said this before and I will say it again - become a characteristic feature of the European Union .
it must remain a mechanism that the Member States may use only when all the other possibilities for progress on the road to integration involving all Members have been ruled out or are not feasible .
reinforced cooperation must not , therefore , become the universal cure-all in order to conceal our weaknesses .
to be more specific , I think that reinforced cooperation cannot be designed as an alternative to qualified majority voting , which remains and will always remain , in the view of the Commission , the main subject under negotiation .
that concludes my comments on the report presented by Mr Gil-Robles .
as a final comment , and this refers to the report presented with great passion by Olivier Duhamel too , I should like to say that the report on reinforced cooperation and Mr Duhamel &apos; s report are both equal to the reputation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
I would therefore like to congratulate the members and the chair of the committee , Mr Napolitano .
moving on to the second report , which we welcome most warmly , Mr Duhamel .
we think your report provides an excellent starting point for the discussion of the constitutional work that we are to begin immediately after nice .
despite this remark , let me say from the outset that our duty , here and now , for the Intergovernmental Conference to succeed , is to concentrate all our energy and all our efforts on the IGC agenda as it stands , in particular when extended to reinforced cooperation . we needs must do this because we are a long way short of the target .
Mr Duhamel , you will undoubtedly agree with me that if nice is not successful , there will be no room , or at least no credibility , for consideration of the future of European integration , at least within the current framework .
we must therefore succeed in nice , and open the doors to enlargement and to new and future reforms . first of all , however , the objective of these negotiations is to get the door open .
yet , inevitably , certain questions are now being asked , so forcefully by yourself , for instance , and must be asked in nice , even if they are not the subject under debate at the Intergovernmental Conference .
I think that nice could be the beginning of the next stages of discussions on several related topics .
first , the reorganisation of the Treaties .
I thank you for the positive reference you made to the study by the European institute in Florence that we commissioned , and I also noted Mr Moscovici &apos; s constructive approach in this respect .
this is a good piece of work that constitutes a basis available for the future exercise of reorganising the treaties .
that is the first point .
the second point is the legal nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , a matter which , as the Presidency said , may well not be answered in nice .
but , like many of you , we think that this work cannot be left at that and we must , perhaps in Article 6 , give this Charter legal force . in any case , I will fight for that .
my third point , finally , is the possible clarification of the definition of competences within the European Union .
I know that Olivier Duhamel &apos; s report essentially slots into a wider perspective : that of a constitutionalisation that would go way beyond the current institutional framework and which would only be completed in the long term .
it seems to me , however , that we need to clarify the current legal and institutional situation first of all , which is what your report also proposes as a first stage : &quot; a reorganised Treaty &quot; , as you say in point 9 of your resolution .
like you , Mr Duhamel , I think the European Union should be equipped with a clear , simpler fundamental text .
it is a necessary and feasible task .
we are not talking about changing the institutional framework established by the Treaties , and certainly not about increasing the competence of the European Union , but about making European construction more user-friendly .
it is essential for European democracy , our primary reason for uniting , as you reminded us , that the citizens have access to a constitutional treaty , a text which , according to the wish of Vaclav Havel , all the children of Europe can learn at school without difficulty .
the important work carried out at our request by the European institute in Florence , to which I have referred , shows that it is legally possible to assemble all these essential elements in a single text comprising a small number of articles .
ladies and gentlemen , the drafting of this fundamental text could be the opportunity to provide answers to other questions of a constitutional nature which will be asked in nice and which I mentioned just now : the legal nature of the Charter and the clarification of competences .
is a reorganised treaty , enriched with other elements of a constitutional nature , already a constitution or must this expression be reserved , as you yourself recommend , Mr Duhamel , for a new fundamental text which would be drafted according to new methods ?
the word &quot; Constitution &quot; does not scare me , I even think I have used it in your presence , ladies and gentlemen , at the very beginning , when I was not yet an official member of the European Commission .
I raised the issue of the constitutionalisation of the Treaties during my hearing before the European Parliament , prior to the investiture of the Commission .
I would like to assure you of my personal availability and even my passion , Mr Duhamel , which will be at least equal to yours , in order to participate in this work .
I would therefore like to indicate my availability and that of the Commission to work in the direction you wish , working through the process of constitutionalisation stage by stage .
in any case , ladies and gentlemen , one thing is clear and must remain so : none of the questions we are discussing can constitute a condition to be achieved prior to the enlargement of the European Union towards the Mediterranean , Baltic , Eastern and Central European countries that are currently candidates .
the Commission is not in favour of calling another Intergovernmental Conference before the first round of enlargement .
the reform of the institutions needed to enable this enlargement to take place must be carried out now and there must be no nice leftovers , in any case definitely not the Amsterdam leftovers .
then there would no longer be any preliminary work at all on our part .
the conclusions of the European Council in nice could announce , in the way you recommend , a mandate and timetable for the work on matters of a constitutional nature .
again , I think that any discussions after nice should be open to all , to the Member States and the candidate States , in a suitable form that we shall have to define .
finally , I think that the Commission , which has participated actively in the work of the Charter and which is participating actively , as is proper , in the work of institutional negotiation , will , after nice , also have to play its part in the collective brainstorming that is related , quite clearly , moreover , to another exercise which we have undertaken on governance .
ladies and gentlemen , my wish is that the Commission , in accordance with the other institutions , should mark out the route to be followed .
it is ready to do so by means of a report to be drawn up following nice on these matters of clarifying competences and simplifying the Treaties , which could be available before the end of the Treaty of nice ratification period .
as for the continuation of the work , I will also say that the report you presented , Mr Duhamel , contains many very interesting ideas .
like you , the Commission was impressed by the quality and form of the work of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights and I think that this method is one worth continuing and from which lessons can be learnt .
you mentioned the idea of a referendum to be held simultaneously in all the Member States .
this too , I feel , is an idea of great symbolic and democratic significance , and I think it is worth looking into .
Mr Duhamel , you spoke with great passion , and that is what this subject requires , given the resistance and reluctance shown by some .
in fact , a great deal of passion is needed here , and that is what we need now , too , in order to make a success of the institutional reform .
we need a great deal of passion , both on your part and on ours , in order to make a breakthrough .
the issues of a possible constitution , a fundamental treaty , the clear definition of competences and the Charter all have one common feature : the fact that they have a political and a democratic dimension , I was about to say a citizens &apos; dimension .
these will give the nice talks , even if they have to be gone into in further detail after nice , that citizens &apos; dimension which the European Union needs .
it has been my opinion for a long time that the main failing of the construction of Europe is that it is a matter for the elite . admittedly it is sometimes handled with courage and tenacity , but it remains in the hands of the elite , behind closed doors , to some extent , as far as the general public is concerned .
the worst scenario for the construction of Europe in the days to come is that this silence will be maintained , as silence is what fuels fears .
this silence encourages all sorts of demagoguery and all sorts of anti-European campaigns .
we must break this silence and initiate debate involving the public , and it is by means of initiatives such as yours , Mr Duhamel , initiatives which can speak to the hearts and minds of our citizens that we shall be able to contribute towards redressing this democratic deficit .
so that is also why I wished to thank you , as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken .
Commissioner Barnier , you made this point a moment ago , and rightly so .
the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and European Democrats will therefore use its large majority to vote in favour of Olivier Duhamel &apos; s outstanding report , which focuses on the essential aspects .
during the first phase , we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force , in a clear and comprehensible manner .
at the same time , however , this constitutional treaty should be elaborated in such a way that it renders the common values of the European Union comprehensible , incorporates the fundamental rights of the European citizens laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and improves the composition , role , and modus operandi of the European Union &apos; s bodies , looking beyond the nice Summit , thereby improving their efficiency .
what this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union , inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed , and provide for joint action to be taken , for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
it is also important , in this context , to respect and safeguard the lowest layer of democracy and local self-administration in the EU Member States .
we must not , as has already happened with a number of directives , end up with an interplay of European and national bureaucracies which restricts and overrides the citizen &apos; s ability to shape policy at a local level .
we therefore propose that local self-administration should form an integral part of a future European constitution and would urge you to endorse this proposed amendment .
Mr President , I would like to focus on the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado , which duly establishes the European Parliament &apos; s position on the fourth of the major issues to be addressed by the current IGC .
it outlines the framework within which reinforced cooperation is to be developed and sets out the conditions that govern it .
this framework must be enforceable both on the countries that want to participate in closer cooperation and on those that are not participating in it or at least not from the start .
reinforced cooperation must therefore respect the principles set out in the Treaties and be conducted within the single institutional framework of the Union .
on the other hand , it must not constitute a barrier to trade or precipitate splits in the common market , breaks in the links of solidarity and cohesion between the Member States or , as Commissioner Barnier has said , an unravelling of the Community acquis .
the implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the European institutions .
in stressing this point , the joint Memorandum from the Benelux countries , as well as Mr Gil-Robles &apos; report , rejects the idea of having a specific secretariat or directorate for each and every closer cooperation initiative .
openness and transparency must be ensured under all circumstances .
no Member State should ever be refused the chance to participate , at any time , in an existing area of reinforced cooperation , and this guarantee must be extended to include future Member States .
the rapporteur is quite correct in firmly stressing the need for the Commission &apos; s powers of initiative and the participation of Parliament , at least on a consultation procedure basis , to be the norm whenever there is reinforced cooperation .
moreover , reinforced cooperation within the three pillars will initially have the objective of moving further towards European integration .
it may also prove essential if we are to overcome persistent obstacles .
on the other hand , should the effect of this reinforced cooperation be to destroy institutional balances , to exclude the Commission and to throw off the democratic control of the European Parliament , it would not be achieving its aims and it would be better to dispense with it .
Mr President , the interested citizen who wants to know how the EU is run is scarcely going to pore over the Treaty of Amsterdam as bedtime reading .
if by chance she should nonetheless do so , it is doubtful if she would be any the wiser .
not even very committed EU cognoscenti could easily plough through those Treaties which in fact regulate a whole range of our common activities here in Europe .
the Treaties are difficult to understand , at times contradictory , difficult to read and uninspiring .
beautiful and important European values are jumbled together with technical clauses in an unholy mess .
this is really quite unacceptable .
if we want to increase knowledge about the European project , as well as commitment to it , there is a minimum requirement that it must be simple to find out how the Union is run and why it is run in that way .
that is not the case today , a fact which Mr Duhamel &apos; s report does an excellent job of bringing out .
following the nice Summit , which we all hope will be successful , it is important to take this next step in order to create a more democratic Union .
it is time to review the Treaties .
for my group , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , it is important that , to begin with , the European Treaties should be made more citizen-friendly .
this means simplifying , rearranging and pruning them . the proposal from the Florence institute suggests a place to start , but the next step is to create a proper European constitution .
the people of Europe need , deserve and , according to opinion polls , want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU &apos; s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States .
people &apos; s rights ought to be regulated by incorporating the conclusions from the Convention .
this is an exciting process .
it is certainly not simple , but it is incredibly important .
naturally , people must be enabled to participate in this work , especially citizens of the candidate countries which will hopefully be members in a few years &apos; time .
the work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement .
a constitution is a matter for the whole of Europe .
work on the constitution ought to be informed by an ambition both to simplify matters and to remove some of the tasks carried out by the EU .
this is necessary if the EU is to be able to function in the future .
a clearer distribution of powers is required , as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle .
we learned a very great deal from the work of the Convention .
it is a working method which , with certain changes , ought to be used to give people a still more important place in the process .
a future European constitution must not be a product off the Brussels drawing board .
Vaclav Havel said in this Chamber , and Commissioner Barnier quoted him recently , that he wanted to see a European constitution which could be handed out to , and understood by , every eleven year-old in Europe .
I think that is a very commendable objective .
the decision to embark upon the work must be taken today .
it is a hopeful sign that the French Presidency is favourably disposed to this .
I shall now do what I can to convince my fellow countrymen to run with the ball during Sweden &apos; s Presidency .
the European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe , by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties , make it legally binding and denying the citizens , whose rights are being infringed , access to the European Court of Justice .
fundamental rights constitute an essential defence against the state .
it is therefore ironic that the Heads of State and Government should be the ones making the decisions about the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe .
is it any wonder that these heads of governments refuse to submit to the regime prescribed by the Charter , and make it legally binding ?
the Council &apos; s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union &apos; s democratic deficit .
not only do the Heads of State and Government want to be the de facto and sole legislators of the Union ; they also want to be its government .
who can still doubt that they regard themselves as the sole providers of the Union &apos; s constitution ?
to a large extent excluding Parliament , the citizens and - where possible - excluding the Commission too .
it has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes .
the question we must ask ourselves today is whether we want a Europe ruled by princes or a European democracy .
if we want a European democracy then we must initiate a constitutional process and make the Charter of Fundamental Rights its cornerstone .
Mr President , Mr Duhamel &apos; s report , which we are discussing today , is a very important one to my mind .
after all , it concerns the all-important question of how the process of European unification is to be further developed .
it is about the future of the European Union .
as is well known , opinion on this differs widely in the various Member States and amongst the various forces of society .
this is also replicated in my own group .
as I see it , this diversity of opinion is indispensable , and also enriches the process , because if we want to build a common European house , we must keep a close eye on whether everyone is keen to live there and also accepts it as their own .
the previous round of European elections showed us just how far the Union still has to go to achieve this goal : low election turn-out , prejudice , justifiable frustration at the lack of democracy and transparency , over-regulation , bureaucracy and opaque decision-making processes .
unfortunately , none of this has changed yet .
but there is an extremely urgent need for radical change .
our Parliament , as the only institution of the Union to have democratic legitimacy , has a big responsibility to lead the way in this respect .
which is precisely why I welcome this report .
we need to simplify and reorganise the Treaties as a matter of urgency .
the text of the Treaties must be comprehensible , above all from the point of view of the citizens .
we need to instigate a constitutional process .
the nice Summit must pave the way for this by granting the necessary mandate , initiating a procedure and setting a timetable .
having said that , Mr President , I am more than sceptical about one particular aspect . firstly , I do not think we will be able , realistically speaking , to adopt the constitution called for in the report in time for next elections in 2004 , and secondly , nor should we in my opinion .
after all , it is unacceptable for the fifteen Member States alone to discuss and decide on a constitution , when we all know full well that by the end of this decade the European Union will have 27 members .
as I see it , there are three key points : firstly , we need a truly wide-ranging public debate in all the Member States .
secondly , the candidate countries must be directly , and fully , involved .
thirdly , I am absolutely convinced that a constitution could only have democratic legitimacy if it were to be made the subject of a Union-wide referendum , because what this in fact amounts to is something akin to the re-establishment of the Union by its citizens .
should we do otherwise , then I do not think a Europe of the citizens will be within our reach .
Mr President , the Duhamel report , which I shall be discussing , once again raises the European Parliament &apos; s old idea of giving Europe a constitution .
the main aim behind this , which is not clearly stated in the resolution , would be to lay down for Europe , even for the fundamental texts , majority-style collective decision-making procedures , completely different , therefore , to the unanimous Council votes or the votes on ratification by Member States used today to amend the Treaties .
these collective procedures would for once and all establish a supranational power in Europe .
we should nevertheless first ask ourselves what exactly our citizens want for the Europe of tomorrow .
their desire is quite clear and was restated with great clarity by the Danish people in their referendum .
our citizens see the national authorities as the most legitimate , and want the main decisions to be taken at national level .
we must therefore conclude that if European cooperation is to remain democratic and close to the people , it must be based on the prevailing situation in each nation .
unfortunately , the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite , and so , of course , we cannot vote for it .
this is why we appended a minority opinion to the European Parliament report and tabled several amendments , which are , in fact , more than amendments , because if they were adopted , the whole meaning of the resolution would be overturned .
Europe needs a Charter that acknowledges the pre-eminence of its national democracies , not a constitution that would turn it into a superstate .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has very real problems , such as poverty , unemployment , taxation , and lack of security , yet what is proposed instead of addressing these issues ?
a constitution !
that is strange enough in itself , but what will this constitution bring ?
in its form , so much hot air !
in its content , nothing but jiggery-pokery !
as to the results it will achieve , a disappearing trick !
the hot air as regards the form is to be found , for example in paragraph 11 of the French version of the Duhamel report , a constitution against , I quote , &quot; a backward step &quot; going backwards .
but a backward step is always backwards !
paragraph 20 speaks of a constitution to discuss , and I quote , &quot; their shared future together &quot; .
but if this future is shared , then obviously they are together .
paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with , and I quote , the &quot; issues not settled &quot; .
well , outstanding accounts may be described as &apos; not settled &apos; , and there may be answers outstanding , but not issues .
according to paragraph 4 , we need a constitution because the Treaties are &quot; unreadable and invisible &quot; .
if it is unreadable , people must have attempted to read it , so it cannot be invisible , and so forth .
what is so serious about Mr Tautology &apos; s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery .
first our nations are abused by this sort of constitutional rapist fiddling with their equality .
in the enhanced European house , some nations will be sitting at the military , monetary , and possibly tax , tables , and others will be left out .
in an √† la carte Europe , we will then have some nations eating from the set menu .
that is why reinforced cooperation means reinforced exclusion .
as nations cannot withstand this attack on their equality , democracy is being abused .
paragraph 8 of the constitutional resolution states that Europe &apos; s constitution must be adopted , and I quote , &quot; with no risk of the process being blocked &quot; and , as paragraph 7 of the Duhamel report says , &quot; without a referendum &quot; there can be no democracy .
and that is where the jiggery-pokery becomes abuse .
the rule of unanimity with the sanction of a veto , if required , is the last bastion protecting the smaller nations and sovereignty .
because it proved impossible to simply do away with the rule of unanimity , it is being sidestepped by means of reinforced cooperation , which is nothing more than the abuse of sovereignty .
who stands to benefit from this ?
the unemployed ?
Pensioners on EUR 700 a month ?
street children ?
the Palestinian children of European society ?
no , it will be the elite that profits from this , the caste which goes by the name of Olivier , Pierre , Dany , all their fathers &apos; sons , the oligarchy .
that is why men and women prefer Zidane and Schumacher , because at least with Zidane , they have the dream of breaking out of the social Palestine in which you imprison them , whereas , with Prodi , the prospect every morning , every evening and every day is gloomy .
Mr President , a whole host of names has already been found for the instrument of reinforced cooperation , presumably with a view to making it more comprehensible to the citizens .
it is not the name though , but the practical form it takes , that will decide whether it will serve the interests of the European Union .
the report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs argues that differentiation can only be deemed to serve any purpose if it is conceived as a process which allows for exceptions to the rule .
however , it seems to me that the report inclines in the opposite direction .
I have always rejected any form of differentiated integration for reasons pertaining to legal theory , but also for pragmatic reasons , believing that it would allow a majority of Member States to determine the direction of policy , and deny countries joining at a later stage any codecision rights in these matters .
I still clearly recall how , in the time before Amsterdam , in what was still the institutional committee , discussions on flexibility went on for weeks .
the arguments against and the warnings about a multi-speed Europe , are still ringing in my ears .
no one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now .
Mr President , I intend to talk about islands .
this conviction was strengthened when declaration No 30 to the new Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted , stating that the intergovernmental conference recognised that island regions faced different problems due to their island status which , because they were permanent problems , hampered their economic and social development , adding that the intergovernmental conference also recognised that Community law should take account of these problems .
unfortunately , our hopes were dashed because , in addition to all their other problems , islands are paying the price for the different translations of the point in question .
according to the first version , the text covers all islands , whereas according to the second version , it only applies to islands with problems .
obviously the second version is incorrect , first because regions lagging behind economically are , in any case , covered by the Structural Funds and , secondly , because if this interpretation were correct , there would have been no point in adopting declaration No 30 .
as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , I should like to reiterate that the European Parliament has always highlighted the fact that island regions are at a permanent disadvantage by reason of their isolation .
Commissioner Barnier , who was in Crete last weekend and whose position I welcome , saw the ships tied up in the harbours in Crete .
they have been tied up for five days now and their cargo is not being moved .
the cost of transportation from an island to the mainland is three times the cost of transportation by road .
farmers are often forced to cultivate a product and , if the product does not do well , it is destroyed .
a kilo of oil , which is a staple product of the Greek islands , costs less than a packet of cigarettes .
and let us not forget that these people sometimes die on small islands when the weather prevents them from being moved to the mainland .
we must therefore move in this direction .
Mr President , despite your final statement , which we would like to be of consequence but we fear will be otherwise , the criticisms made a while ago by this Assembly regarding the current Intergovernmental Conference have proven to be justified .
firstly , with regard to the method , which is a tired , lifeless procedure according to public opinion , which in fact marginalises the other institutions of the European Union and in which governments are victims of their own labyrinth .
second , with regard to an inadequate agenda , which has left out issues that are particularly relevant to the future of the European Union and its citizens &apos; interests .
in spite of everything , however , at least the agenda has included one very important point , reinforced cooperation , which must be seen as an incentive for progress and not for dispersal or creating cabinets .
this will help to stimulate European construction beyond this IGC and possibly in spite of this IGC .
in order to achieve this objective we must ask the nice Council to open up the important reformist approach that can bring together political consensus and public support .
we need a constitution for the European Union , and this constitution must start right now by including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty in nice .
Mr President , I shall focus my scant sixty seconds on the report by Mr Duhamel , which is a good report , because it has the courage to state things clearly and the eloquence of our rapporteur just now has finally convinced us .
yes , the intergovernmental method , in which one blockage appears after another , is close to collapse and this is not going to be belied by the Treaty being presented on the cheap at nice .
yes , it is in the greater interest of the democracy of our continent to have a new founding text and a clear and effective constitution .
and yes , the drafting of this fundamental law must be steered by the most direct representatives of our citizens , the European Parliament , and must be ultimately validated by the citizens themselves .
what would happen , however , if the work of the Convention described in the Duhamel report were to become bogged down indefinitely and this constitution which so many people , from Fischer to Chirac , wish to see , were not to be declared until 2004 ?
in this case , as stated in my Group &apos; s Amendment No 37 , we should have to go back , in order to reach a decision , to the sovereign people and give the European Parliament that will be elected in 2004 a clear mandate for a constitution .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the point raised by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Segni on the status of the islands which are part of the European Union is an old , controversial issue which clearly cannot be limited to purely linguistic points .
the issue is a political one and must be tackled and resolved once and for all as such .
I find it difficult to understand how it is that the Treaty can call for social and economic cohesion to be achieved if , years on , we have still not succeeded in eliminating the ambiguity of the treatment reserved for the islands , which is due to the contradiction between Article 158 of the Treaty and Declaration 30 on the island regions , annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
can we not , at last , put an end to this ridiculous line of reasoning which decrees that some islands shall be disadvantaged and others privileged solely on the basis of how far they are from land ?
I represent the constituency which contains the two largest islands in the Mediterranean - Sicily and Sardinia - and I can say in all honesty that both islands are severely disadvantaged in structural terms precisely because they are islands .
I will end by calling upon Parliament to make every effort to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference restores to the islands their right to grow and develop .
Mr President , we have heard that progress was made at Biarritz on closer cooperation .
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Gil-Robles , on a clear lucid report setting out Parliament &apos; s position .
my British Conservative colleagues support moves towards greater flexibility .
we have reservations on the abolition of the veto and progressive elimination of the pillared structure so we shall be constrained to abstain on the overall vote .
Minister , it is recorded that on the eve of the Bolshevik revolution - an event that was to have such desperate consequences throughout the world - the Russian Orthodox Church was engaged in complex discussions on the design of vestments during Lent .
this is an apocryphal story to illustrate the dangers of dwelling on the detail of technical matters to the extent of obscuring the massive challenges to be faced .
I hope the Treaty of nice is achieved and seen to be a success and that closer cooperation is included as a welcome move in the direction of flexibility .
but will it be sufficient to ensure that enlargement takes place within the timetable envisaged ?
Mr Moscovici , will the nice Treaty really be welcomed and acclaimed in Warsaw , Prague , Budapest , Tallinn and Ljubljana ?
unless this is the case , it would not be a victory , merely another missed opportunity .
I hope that the French Presidency will find a more efficient and imaginative way of assuring the candidate countries and the public throughout Europe that we are not only addressing important technical issues but above all the political necessity to provide our continent with stability through the certain and guaranteed enlargement of our European Union .
enlargement , Mr President , forces us to face up to the question of whether we intend to move towards purely economic Union or to continue in our endeavour to achieve political Union .
in my view , the unity of Europe cannot but be political .
a simple single economic area , even with a single currency , is no replacement for political Union .
we cannot put this sort of limitation on our ambitions because that would presage the break-up of the Union , even of economic Union .
obviously , it would be best if we had or if , in nice , we could set up institutions to take single common decisions by a suitable majority , possibly a double majority of populations and Member States , which are binding on us all .
no such institutions exist , or at least not to the required extent .
even if all the demands of the French Presidency for qualified majority voting are accepted , large areas of political cooperation will remain uncovered .
reinforced cooperation is therefore a de facto requirement , not as an ideal solution , it is certainly not that , but as a practical solution in a time of need , of vital need .
we must accommodate the Member States which are willing and have the power to move forward and block the Member States which are not willing to move forward .
the danger , however , is that reinforced cooperation will break up the unity of Europe through the back door , resulting in a patchwork of intergovernmental cooperation .
cooperation must therefore offer all the guarantees proposed by the rapporteur , be open to all the Member States , respect the spirit of the Treaties and not undermine the acquis communautaire .
we need Parliament to control these issues , but I share the view of the President-in-Office that control must not turn into a new veto .
if , therefore , we insist that Parliament must be able to exercise preventive control , we will have to confine ourselves to controlling questions of legality , not political expediency .
in addition , the initiative of the Member States ought to be non-binding ; more importantly it cannot be subject to a Commission proposal for an initiative because that would do away with the initiative of the Member States .
Mr President , two brief observations regarding the reports on our agenda today .
with regard to the Gil-Robles report , I can simply say that it is an example of sound work carried out by our Committee and that the vast majority of our Group will support the report .
the Duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting . I would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our Group .
the first amendment concerns the duration of the Convention &apos; s work .
in our opinion , the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections .
two years of work should be more than sufficient and we hope that the majority of Parliament will support Amendment No 37 .
the second point concerns the difference between the first and second stages .
we feel that it is essential not so much to simplify and consolidate the Treaty as to turn it into a succinct Constitution which all the European citizens will find readable .
I therefore feel that it is not really feasible to divide the work into two stages .
in conclusion , I would in any case like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work and to assure them of the support of my Group .
Mr President we are at a crucial juncture , firstly because the report by Mr Gil-Robles , which I will cover in just one sentence , enables us to identify and support opportunities for closer cooperation and to dispel the risks and , from that point of view , it is a very good piece of work .
nevertheless , I would like to concentrate on the Duhamel report , to emphasise how much progress the idea of a constitution has made , including in this House .
everyone , or almost everyone , who has spoken has done so in support of this idea and we feel that this is already a huge victory .
why are all these people fighting and militating for the idea of a constitution ?
they are doing so in order to ensure that Europe becomes a democracy . in other words , all the decisions that are now trapped within the so-called intergovernmental debate , discussions in the corridors of power and behind-the-scenes diplomacy , all these decisions that are taken behind closed doors and shrouded in obscurity will become the business of the citizens , the general public , European public opinion .
we , of course , take the view that this is the purpose of the constitution , over and above the already positive purpose of clarifying the Treaties .
as a result of the Duhamel report , we finally have a credible script .
even if this two-stage process is not ideal , at least we can see where we are going .
my last point is that , when it comes to drafting the Constitution for real , the key point will be to determine wherein the legitimacy of the European authority lies , and , in our opinion , it must come from the peoples , from our citizens and their representatives , the European Parliament and perhaps the national parliaments .
democracy is the power of the people .
Mr President , I should like to say a few words to the effect that , in my opinion , the Duhamel report is a truly excellent document , which makes quite substantial progress .
in fact , I wish it went even further and explicitly discussed a constitution and not merely a framework treaty , a type of treaty , a single treaty or a treaty of treaties , which nevertheless incorporates the Declaration of Fundamental Rights .
I concede , however , that the political situation has not been conducive to going that far and I therefore give my unreserved support to the Duhamel report currently before us .
at the same time , there is one point I would like to highlight . I do not think it is right that we should call for or move towards the requirement for a compulsory referendum in every Member State to approve the specific amendments that have been proposed .
in Portugal , for example , we did not hold a referendum to approve our membership of the European Community or to approve the Maastricht Treaty . these issues were approved by Parliament , in the context of effective representative democracy .
I fail to see why we should force all Member States to hold referendums , regardless of whether these form part of their traditions or not .
that is my only reservation .
in any case , I warmly congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Duhamel , on his excellent work .
Mr President , where is the journey into , and with , a united Europe to lead ?
the debates we are having now will add something to this key issue , which is to be addressed in the decades to come .
do we in fact need a constitution for Europe ?
to what extent should certain important competences , which hitherto have been the preserve of individual Member States , now be the subject of Community policy ?
the excellent reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado expertly point the way on both issues : improved intelligibility of the Treaties , a constitutional framework , fundamental rights , delimitation of competences , constitutional state , democracy and separation of powers ; no superstate in Europe , a new method of developing the Treaties .
the Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues .
the same goes for the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado .
reinforced cooperation , so as to escape the stranglehold exerted by national vetos .
at the same time , we must be sure to retain a European approach , even in areas of reinforced cooperation , and ensure that reinforced cooperation does not exclude countries , but brings them closer together in the long run .
both reports leave some questions open , i.e. the answers given are only of a provisional nature .
do we really want to hold direct referendums on key European issues ?
we venture a tentative &apos; yes &apos; .
however , this issue still needs to be discussed in greater depth do we really want to let a third of the Member States press on ahead ?
do we not need at least half of them ?
we would prefer it if as many Member States as possible could tread the common European path in unison .
our task for the future is to make this a reality .
reinforced cooperation between a few countries cannot be in the interests of Europe as a whole .
Mr President , the question tabled by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , refers to a very real issue and I think Commissioner Barnier &apos; s response and that of the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Moscovici , were very clear .
that is , there is an error in the Italian version of the text resulting from an incorrect translation .
consequently , the description &quot; less developed &quot; is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and , according to Mr Barnier &apos; s proposal , what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty , in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention .
on the other hand , I believe that we should welcome the information that Mr Barnier has just given us ; he has proposed a study of the specific problems of the island regions , in accordance with Article 158 and Declaration No 30 , appended to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I believe that this would actually be enough to solve the problem raised by the question by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Mr President , the European Union &apos; s achievement has been to interpose a European-wide transnational legal order between national and international law based on the Treaties which , as the European Court of Justice has pointed out , have some of the characteristics of a constitution .
no-one would hold up the existing structure of the Treaties as a model of their kind and it must be in the interests of the politician , administrator , businessman and citizen to simplify their structure .
the proposals in the Duhamel report which do that must be welcomed .
the second part of his report is more ambitious and hence contentious , questioning the mechanics of the way in which the Treaties - and hence the quasi-constitution - is changed .
it is true that to an English common lawyer this is unknown territory . but to those in the United States , Canada or Australia this is much more familiar ground .
it is an important topic which requires serious attention .
I say to my own countrymen that it should not be dismissed out of hand .
rather , while I am far from convinced by a number of the detailed proposals in the report , I welcome the debate it opens because it raises important questions which require thought-through , considered and dispassionate answers .
Mr President , as the last speaker , I too should like to congratulate Mr Duhamel on his excellent work and Mr Gil-Robles on his work .
we have had an in-depth debate on two issues which , although different , converge at one point .
and both reports basically deal with the manner in which the European process is to continue ; the manner in which the framework and the vision of Europe are to be shaped still further .
Mr Gil-Robles &apos; proposals on reinforced cooperation are , on balance , positive .
at the same time , Mr Duhamel &apos; s proposals for a constitutional charter for the European Constitution , a constitution of which we are in dire need , are also fundamental .
and now a word to the President-in-Office , Minister Moscovici .
the European Parliament has tabled important proposals .
now what we need is for the summit in nice to demonstrate the political will to ensure that the nice Treaty combines these proposals , and other proposals formulated on other occasions , into an integrated institutional framework which allows the European process to advance properly and the European Union to welcome the new Member States in a positive and sound manner .
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote on the reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado will take place shortly .
the vote on the resolution on the oral questions with regard to the status of the islands will take place on Wednesday .

report ( A5-0294 / 2000 ) by Mrs Eriksson , on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001-2005 ) &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 335 - C5-0386 / 2000 - 2000 / 0143 ( CNS ) &#93;
Eriksson ( GUE / NGL ) , rapporteur .
( SV ) Mr President , in accordance with Rule 69 ( 2 ) , I want the discussion of this matter to be discontinued now and re-referred to the Committee .
we have now obtained a clear position from Parliament but , after yesterday &apos; s debate , it is unclear what the other institutions want .
I therefore wish to insist upon re-referral to the Committee .
Mr President , it is probably in order for myself , as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee , to say that we have done our best to fulfil both the Council &apos; s and the Commission &apos; s desire to get this proposal through quickly .
we have worked a little too quickly .
in the course of yesterday &apos; s debate , we did not , unfortunately , obtain clarity on those issues which really need to be clarified by the Council and the Commission .
we therefore want the matter re-referred to ourselves .
we are ready to ensure that it can be put to the vote during the November part-session so that it may , in that way , also be possible for it to be adopted during the French Presidency .
I therefore support Mrs Eriksson &apos; s proposal on behalf of the Committee .
( Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the Committee responsible )
report ( A5-0277 / 2000 ) by Mrs Sartori , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments ( Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1969 / 88 ) &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 628 - C5-0307 / 2000 - 2000 / 0807 ( CNS ) &#93;

report ( A5-0281 / 2000 ) by Mr Jonathan Evans , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission &apos; s eighth survey on state aid in the European Union &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 205 - C5-0430 / 2000 - 2000 / 2211 ( COS ) &#93;
amendment No 3 :
Mr President , with regard to Amendment No 3 , the votes were 72 for and 56 against .
since the honourable Member said she would vote against , this amendment is repealed .
that does not alter the outcome .
I am quite clear about that in my mind .
Mr President , I was seeking your clarification of the Rules on the set of circumstances that were just raised .
if a machine is not working , is it the case that a vote that is entirely disregarded ?
if so , it seems to me that is a matter that may require of an amendment in the Rules of this House .
it clearly is the case that the intention of the House was , by a tied vote , not to carry that particular measure .
Mr Evans , it is , pursuant to the Rules , for the President to decide whether the result was valid or not .
needless to say , the President always hopes that all voting machines are working .
should a machine not be in working order , this does not in any way affect the conclusion reached by the President that this vote was carried out in a lawfully valid manner , and I obviously have no intention of changing that conclusion .
these are the rules .
neither do I intend to change the Rules of Procedure .
that is how it is .
I do not want a debate on this .
the rules , ladies and gentlemen , are crystal clear .
Mr President , I know you hope all the voting machines were working . I am afraid mine did not , so that made the majority &quot; two &quot; , not &quot; one &quot; .
that is making matters too complicated , Mr Howitt .
I will not take this into consideration .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I am sorry to rise again on a point of order but I do so to challenge the ruling you made earlier , not in the context of the debate but in the context of the Rules of this House .
if there is an equality of votes and if the honourable Member did vote , even though her machine did not work , then the procedure in any parliamentary assembly is that amendment falls .
therefore , in those circumstances I want you to tell me which part of our Rules suggests that your ruling is right , when clearly it is not .
Mr Atkins , that is not how we are going to do things here .
the rules are crystal clear .
we held a small procedural debate on it a moment ago .
virtually all Members of the House are familiar with this rule .
the President decides on the validity of the votes .
I am interested to hear that other parliaments do things differently , but in this Parliament , our rules apply .
Mr President , I am able to dispel an illusion that certain MEPs have .
during the vote , which is the subject of the dispute , I voted against by mistake ; I actually wanted to vote in favour .
I have already notified the Registry .
there was therefore more than one surplus vote .
Mr President , what is being asked for here is a recipe for chaos .
as we have heard , some people voted the wrong way , some people &apos; s machines did not work .
the Rules as they stand are quite acceptable and ensure that you will not have a situation where some people have not voted , where some people &apos; s machines did not work .
we cannot change the Rules .
otherwise it would make things quite impossible : when we have a very tight vote with only a difference of one or two votes , there would be people jumping up all over the place saying their machine did not work , they did not vote , or whatever .
it is better as it stands .
Mrs McKenna , you are absolutely right .
I believe we can now close the subject .
the vote was clear .
the result was established by the President .
it is valid .
there is nothing to add to or detract from this .
I suggest , honourable Members , that we do not discuss the matter any further .
Mr President , it is now almost 2 p.m .
could you ask the House if wishes to continue voting or if it wishes to stop ?
.
( FR ) behind the convoluted wording of this text , there is an outline of a raft of measures , all harmful to workers .
what is the meaning of the expression &quot; the deadline within which Member States are required to guarantee unemployed individuals a chance to access an active employment measure should not exceed two years &quot; , if not a threat to unemployment benefits ?
what is the meaning of &quot; the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually , via part-time work &quot; , if not a threat to the age of retirement , which is already far too high in many countries ?
there is no ambiguity about the repeated calls for making flexibility in employment more common .
with regard to the passage on work experience in companies , apprenticeships , joint work / training contracts , it aims to make more widespread a practice already adopted by many States which consists , on the pretext on helping workers or unemployed young people , of making a partially or completely subsidised workforce available to employers .
the icing on the cake for the property-owning classes is the report &apos; s recommendation of something already practised by many States , which is &quot; the contributions in respect of fiscal and parafiscal charges &quot; by the authorities on &quot; domestic work &quot; , which clearly means taxpayers &apos; subsidising the maids and chauffeurs that the rich are likely to hire .
texts like these confirm the fact that the role allotted to the European institutions , including Parliament , is to be of service to the narrow band of the well-to-do .
it significant that the report reiterates that full employment is one of the Europe &apos; s key objectives under its strategy for economic , employment and social policy . nevertheless , we must also ensure that we move beyond vague statements and make genuine changes to our macroeconomic and social policies in order to make real progress towards full employment and good-quality jobs .
the report does well to state the need to reduce gender gaps with regard to employment , unemployment , pay and sectoral segregation by 50 % in the Member States over the next five years . it is also crucial , however , for there to be a real improvement in good-quality jobs , in salaries and in professional development , which we have not yet seen .
recommendation for second reading - Trakatellis ( A5-0268 / 2000 )
I welcome the EP &apos; s adoption of the Trakatellis report as it provides for the setting of high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives .
EU citizens are entitled to expect the highest level of safety with blood products .
it is imperative that we safeguard the health , safety and confidence of patients , users and third parties and set conditions on placing such products on the market .
we must at the same time seek to guarantee continuity of supply of safe products at affordable prices to both individual citizens and public health authorities .
there is an Italian proverb which says , literally : &quot; laughter makes good blood &quot; .
Pensioners and the elderly - who , like everybody else , would like to have a healthy circulation - therefore approve of the fact that , every so often , I am able to introduce a lighter note into our proceedings , such as this preamble to my explanation of why I voted for the Trakatellis report .
my reason for voting for the report is , of course , that Pensioners and elderly people are greatly concerned with their health , for it is they who are most frequently hospitalised , and they therefore welcome not only the movement of goods but also the healthy circulation of the blood .
Souchet report ( A5-0228 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the Souchet report which is intended to further facilitate the process of turning agricultural products into packaged agricultural products .
as you know , Pensioners , like children , love eating jam .
MacCormick report ( A5-0304 / 2000 )
we have voted in favour of Mr MacCormick &apos; s report seeking to uphold Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity .
it is not that we think that the purpose of immunity is to place any Member of this House above the law , but because it is , in certain cases , necessary in order to protect the institution and the independence of its Members in the face of measures of persecution .
many of us noted the very important development , in section II , paragraph D , on the &quot; Independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity . &quot;
it is because parliamentary immunity is independent that our institution has the power to review requests for waiver , particularly with regard to &apos; fumus persecutionis &apos; i.e. the presumption that criminal proceedings have been brought with the intention of causing the Member political damage .
if we have the power to review requests for waiver , then we have all the more the right to consider breaches of parliamentary immunity , when this is attacked without such a request even being presented !
if European parliamentary immunity is independent , the French authorities ought to have consulted us regarding the waiver of Mr le pen &apos; s immunity .
we ought to have studied the outrageous reversal of the concept of flagrante delicto which those authorities committed .
before passing judgement , the French Court of appeal and the Council of State ought to have notified the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that the question had been referred for a preliminary ruling .
in the absence of these crucial formalities , the President of the European Parliament clearly ought not to have allowed a criminal trial instigated in completely invalid conditions to have any effect on Mr le pen &apos; s mandate .
this is the legal course that our Parliament should follow in order to be consistent with its principles and its legal code , as well as with the letter and the spirit of the treaties .
a great many of us here would like to hear this stated by the Court of Luxembourg , which is the guardian of the law .
Kla√ü report ( A5-0195 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted against the Kla√ü report .
this is because it confirms the possibility of turning traditional vines into GMO vines and therefore the possibility that , in the future , we will be drinking genetically modified wine .
I asked the Pensioners who sent me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioners &apos; Party whether they would like to drink genetically modified wine .
they replied : &apos; if genetically modified wine were to cure me of my liver trouble or to prevent me getting liver trouble , then I would be quite happy to drink it .
otherwise , why should I agree to drink wine which is different to the wine our ancestors always drank ? &apos;
Mr President , in the course of this discussion on the Kla√ü report , I have been unable to comprehend why some people have persistently confused the terms &apos; genotype &apos; and &apos; genetic modification &apos; .
this has actually hampered the discussion because &apos; genotype &apos; is a prototype in wine , and wine growing is an extremely varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures .
Vine material provides the basis for optimum grape and wine production in terms of quality , class and quantity .
therefore we need these types of vine in order to preserve the variety of the wine , in terms of characteristic flavour , and to prevent cut-price enterprises from undermining this regional variety of vine propagating material and working against it .
I am particularly disappointed at the European Parliament &apos; s vote on the report on the reproduction of vine plants .
I am disappointed that Parliament has neither understood nor tried to understand the message of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the Greens , who have tried to draw attention to the underhand way in which the executive committee acted in order to water down the issue of GMOs in its reports so that we will end up with vast amounts of them on our plates and in our glasses .
in my country , Greece , vines are extremely important ; they are an integral feature of the landscape and have been bound up with its culture and economy for centuries .
and , Greece is the only Member State which produces and exports raisins .
material for the vegetative propagation of the vine must meet high specifications both from the phytosanitary point of view and as regards certification of the variety or clone , since it is the initial material which a vine-grower wishing to produce high quality vine products and safeguard his income will use to start a vineyard .
we all know that the directive on material for the vegetative propagation of the vine needed amending , because huge changes have taken place in the 32 years since it was drawn up , both on the market and in the technical and scientific area .
the changes dictated by the situation on the ground and the requirements of the sector need to be made , but they need to be made in a direction which serves producers and consumers and the report does not move in this direction .
to be precise , there is no scientific proof that genetically-modified vine varieties pose no risk to human health or the environment and the fact that authorisation may be granted only if all the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health does not constitute a safety valve .
at no point does the report clarify either who will grant the authorisation or what controls will be carried out .
given that research into genetically-modified products has been developed and is controlled by a number of large multinational companies which are only interested in increasing their profits and have no interest in protecting human health or the environment , the precarious nature of the supposed authorisation and controls , which are riddled with holes , gives even greater cause for concern .
it is proposed to allow material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which meets reduced specifications to be marketed when temporary difficulties arise without , however , specifying what these difficulties might be .
or even , by way of derogation , for standard material for vegetative propagation to be supplied when demand cannot be met from other categories .
the main point here is that material for vegetative propagation which meets reduced specifications gives a poorer quality vineyard , thereby jeopardising the vine-grower &apos; s income , while suppliers are in a win-win situation because they are able to sell poor quality products .
as far as the definition of the clone is concerned , it is inadequate because , basically , the clone is a sub-division of the variety with special characteristics which have to be made known and the definition given does not cover this .
we note that a newer , more complete definition has been issued by the committee of vine experts .
as far as new scientific techniques such as in vitro propagation are concerned , reference should be made to the fact that meristem propagation is excluded from in vitro propagation of material because , as we all know from numerous years &apos; experience and experiments by institutes , mutations occur when these points of the plant are used .
in this proposal , economic interests have prevailed over other considerations .
when that happens , this very often has unforeseen adverse implications .
in a number of Member States , growing grapes constitutes an important economic sector , especially since they are used to produce alcohol .
to some , alcohol , like tobacco and drugs , is a product which can cause a great deal of harm to the users and the people around them ; to others , it is mainly a source of employment which can generate large sums of money .
the proposal to amend the directive on the marketing of vegetative propagation material of the vine is being justified as a tool to reinforce the internal market and to bring a 30-year old regulation up-to-date .
however , it also seems to be about widening the scope for genetic manipulation .
yesterday , the proposal of the Greens and Social Democrats to postpone the decision on the Kla√ü report until a broader decision-making process on the genetic manipulation of plants is in place , was turned down by a narrow majority of this Parliament .
for me , this is a reason not to vote in favour of the Kla√ü report , certainly not at this stage .
Riis-J√∏rgensen report ( A5-0290 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the Riis-J√∏rgensen report , although it does have some shortcomings .
yesterday , I overheard Mr Smith , an Englishman talking to Mr Rossi , an Italian .
they are old friends and work in the same profession : they both work for furniture factories .
Mr Smith &apos; s salary is ITL 2.5 million per month whereas Mr Rossi earns less : only ITL 2 million per month .
the reason is that Mr Smith &apos; s pension contributions are low whereas the amount paid by Mr Rossi is very high .
but why ?
this situation is due to the fact that British pension laws make workers &apos; pension contributions bring more return than Italian laws .
I therefore put it to you , Mr President : are not such discrepancies in contributions also a restriction upon free competition in the European Union ?
we must give credit to the explanatory statement of this report for stating , quite openly , that , &quot; Competition policy is clearly one of the most important policies of the European Union . &quot;
this is really a polite euphemism for the true state of affairs .
the sole purpose of the European institutions is to try to set some rules for competition .
even if it is regulated , the law of the jungle still applies , which means that , whatever industrial or financial groups hold sway , working class consumers and workers are always the victims .
it is significant that the only aspect of State aid to businesses that perturbs the rapporteur is &quot; distortion to competition &quot; and not the fact that this aid always means that the majority of the population is being robbed to help major companies generate private profit for their shareholders .
with regard to company mergers , which the rapporteur hopes that the Commission will assess , such an assessment should describe not only the competitive advantages and the additional benefits that companies gain from them .
it would also be useful if the assessment showed how many redundancies they cause , because all the mergers that have been authorised by the Brussels Commission have led to restructuring or , in other words , redundancies .
these mergers may have brought profits to the shareholders in the companies involved , but they have also cost their workers , their families and society as a whole very dear .
in April 1999 , the Commission proposed a wide-ranging reform of the Community system of competition with regard to the application of Article 81 ( prohibiting agreements between undertakings ) and Article 82 ( prohibiting the abuse of dominant position ) .
the rapporteur generally welcomes the proposals in the Commission White Paper on this subject but is apprehensive of the possible implications of the reform , which aims principally to decentralise the implementation of competition rules .
she feels that abolishing the notification and authorisation systems and enhancing the role of national legal systems in disputes concerning Community competition law will lead to the renationalisation of this policy .
while we would not all agree with every aspect of EU competition policy , it has certainly been a successful policy over a period of 43 years and it has helped to prohibit the abuse of dominant positions by companies within the European Union .
I would not like to see a situation where the primacy of Community law with regard to the implementation of EU competition rules and regulations was threatened in any shape or form .
the uniform application of EU competition laws throughout the EU must be paramount .
therefore , I welcome the call by the rapporteur to the European Commission to provide additional guarantees concerning the application of competition law within the Member States .
this will include , in particular , involving the European Parliament more closely in drawing up and implementing competition policy and monitoring the quality of legislation on competition within the various Member States of the EU and the applicant countries to the EU .
there must be clear mechanisms set up for allocating cases between national authorities and the European Commission in order to prevent shopping around for the most advantageous legal system which might be available for various legal applicants .
in principle , the decentralised application of Community law can only be a success if there are strong commitments given that this will be uniformly applied across all the territories of the European Union .
the social dimension is totally absent from the report and the rapporteur even goes so far as to state that &quot; when examining whether a conduct restricts competition , focus should be on the harm caused to competition , not to the competitors . &quot; its view is that that &quot; competition cases should be based on economic analysis &quot; .
the report also advocates mergers between companies , even between those on a large scale , on the pretext of international competitiveness , but it ignores any social consequences that may result from this situation .
we therefore felt bound to vote against the report , which is what we did .
Jonathan Evans report ( A5-0281 / 2000 )
Mr President , in order to explain the reasons for my declaration with reservations in favour of the Evans report , I would like , this time , to tell you about a conversation between Carlo and Fran√ßois . they are the same age , 50 years old , and they have been doing the same job for the same number of years .
Carlo has invited Fran√ßois to dinner .
&apos;Why are you inviting me to dinner ? &apos; asks Fran√ßois .
and Carlo replies : &apos; I am inviting you to dinner because , although I am still a young man - 50 years old - I have been given early retirement by my government .
tomorrow I am not going to work , I will become a pensioner , because my country , Italy , has a system of early retirement .
however , I know that you will have to continue to work for another 10 years .
that is why I am inviting you to dinner . &apos;
I put it to you once again , Mr President : is this not also a State aid which should be included in the survey ?
Mr Fatuzzo , I am unable to answer that question , for this is an explanation of vote .
I am not the executive but rather the President of this House at this moment in time .
during the debate yesterday evening , I welcomed the work of Mr Evans , but I was immediately bound to express my deep disagreement with the rather too liberal , not to say ultraliberal , tenor of his report .
hence my recommendation last night not to endorse the report as it stands .
I added that the supervision of state aid should be carried out within the strict framework of the Treaties &apos; provisions and not according to the prevailing liberal ideology .
I believe that , somewhere between the &apos; all-powerful state &apos; , which nobody wants anymore , and the &apos; non-existent state &apos; , which is simply the modern form of the survival of the fittest , this thing that many would call the &apos; European social model &apos; requires us to look for the balance between what can be regulated by the market and what state authorities should regulate !
that is why I put forward and voted for the Socialist Group &apos; s amendments .
as the right forced them to fight , I did not vote for the report .
state aids have been traditionally used by Member States as instruments of industrial and social policy .
notwithstanding the move towards greater deregulation within the European Union , state aids can still play a constructive role in achieving social and economic progress .
I am a member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Connaught / Ulster .
this whole region has been classified as an Objective 1 area for the seven-year period 2000-2006 .
if a particular region is accorded such classification then the businesses which set up in that region are entitled to receive a higher percentage of state aid than within a non-Objective 1 region .
in fact , one can recall that 40 % grant aid is available for fixed investment costs for new businesses setting up within the Objective 1 region in Ireland .
there can also be a further top-up arrangement of 15 % for fixed investment costs for small and medium sized enterprises .
for the purposes of this grant aid , a small and medium-sized enterprise is a company that employs less then 250 people .
permission to grant such grant aid to companies setting up in the Objective 1 region serves a very positive economic and social purpose .
it ensures that the further drift from rural to urban areas may be arrested .
it also ensures that greater inward investment can take place into this region in an effort to bolster job opportunities for young people growing up in such areas .
I welcome the recent statement that radical changes are now being implemented by IDA Ireland in terms of attracting more jobs to the Objective 1 region in Ireland .
IDA Ireland has been reorganising that focus so as to win half of all new jobs from Greenfield projects in the Objective 1 region over the coming three years .
this re-focus is beginning to take effect and given time and the implementation of the Government &apos; s programmes on infrastructure , as outlined in the National Development Plan for the period 2000-2006 , the IDA is certainly confident that it can reach this target for new projects in the Objective 1 region .
there are too many regions presently at a disadvantage from an uncompetitive infrastructure and from the lack of the business support services which are needed if the required level of new and modern business investment is to be achieved .
I believe the Regional State Aid guidelines which have been put in place to help job creation in the Objective 1 region can be implemented in their entirety and will redress regional imbalances which exist in Ireland and elsewhere .
I would also point out that many Irish-speaking areas within the constituency of Connaught / Ulster and Udaras Na Gaeltachta will also be playing a pivotal role in creating new industries in the Objective 1 region over the coming years .
my opinion of paragraphs 4 , 17 and 18 is positive , but is negative on paragraph 2 , on the other hand .
state aid should certainly not serve as an incentive for companies to relocate from one Member State to another .
that would only encourage companies to use government funding to make labour more flexible by constantly moving to the areas with the lowest wages , worst working conditions , lowest prices for land and the most backward environmental requirements .
I drew the attention of the European Commission to this issue in July 1999 , and received a positive response .
I therefore agree with the thrust of paragraph 4 which supports this viewpoint .
I am less pleased with the idea expressed in paragraph 2 that state aid should not go up .
that aid could well be indispensable to the protection of the environment and public services and to guaranteeing equal income levels for people living in economically disadvantaged regions .
I back the criticism voiced with regard to tax exemptions , which fuels unfair competition in favour of aviation , as compared with other modes of transport , and I also support the incentives to save energy and look into renewable energy sources .
my final verdict is therefore positive .
Unbridled competition has become the latest neo-liberal fad .
the principle of market rules as the sole form of social regulation tends to do away with man and his creativity as individuals in the economy and the productive process and , more importantly , is indifferent to man &apos; s prosperity and only interested in the welfare of enterprise .
everyone knows that , even if the rules of competition are transparent and apply to everyone , not that this ever was or ever will be the case , not everyone has access to those rules on equal terms , with the result that the familiar law of the jungle applies , might is right and monopolies rule OK .
sometimes , when the consequences of this policy cause an outcry , state intervention , aid and other economic and fiscal incentives come along and go some way to restoring the situation .
intervention does not even break the surface of the capitalist system and often supports selected companies and businesses .
however , it is not these &quot; deviations &quot; that are being targeted in the desperate attempt to abolish state aid ; its purpose is to increase the profits of strong companies and consolidate their position on the market without any danger from new competitors .
the less developed regions of the EU , the less developed sectors and the poorer social classes know that , without state intervention , the development differential will increase steadily at their expense .
they know that , without a strong , productive and efficient public sector , there is no light at the end of the tunnel .
they also know that the economy is being restructured and the public sector sold off not for their benefit but in order to support big business and increase its profitability .
selling off the nation &apos; s silver is one of the quickest ways to weaken the grass roots factor and minimise the means at its disposal .
in other words , apart from increasing profitability , it also hands big business an important political weapon to combat grass-roots demands .
we find the constant pressures and concomitant institutional measures , such as the proposed state aid register and scoreboard , unacceptable .
there is a danger , once the EU is safely in control of large state aid , of its turning its attention to small-scale aid on the pretext of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises .
big business is showing , in the choices it is making , that it is seriously worried about the possibility of competitiveness controls by the Member States , not by the Commission of the EU .
the intolerable situation being forced on workers by the choices made by large companies and the EU is already causing widespread reaction .
the number of demonstrations against &quot; globalisation &quot; and the rule of the uncontrolled laws of the market is increasing rapidly .
attempts to erode measures to protect workers still further , the attack from all fronts on the rights which they have fought for , in conjunction with attempts to minimise the specific weight of the public sector and the balancing function which state aid can exercise , do nothing except increase grass-roots dissatisfaction and leave workers no choice but to fight and resist .
that concludes the votes .

2001 budget procedure
the next item is the joint discussion on :
the report ( A5-0300 / 2000 ) by Mrs Haug , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the EU draft general budget for 2001 : section III , Commission , ( C5-0300 / 2000 - 1999 / 2190 ( BUD ) )
the report ( A5-0292 / 2000 ) by Mr Ferber , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the EU draft general budget for 2001 ( C5-0300 / 2000 - 1999 / 2191 ( BUD ) )
section I , European Parliament ;
section II , Council ;
section IV , Court of Justice ;
section V , Court of Auditors ;
section VI , Economic and Social Committee ;
section VII , Committee of the Regions ;
section VIII , Ombudsman
the report ( A5-0251 / 2000 ) by Mrs R√ºhle , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the ECSC draft operating budget for 2001 ( COM ( 2000 ) 360 - C5-0340 / 2000 - 2000 / 2060 ( BUD ) )
the report ( A5-0236 / 2000 ) by Mr Colom i Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the Interinstitutional Agreement on financial statements .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would also have been delighted to welcome our Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . budgetary discussions are nearly always guided by the principle that money is not everything , but without money , all is nothing .
it is marvellous to have you with us Commissioner .
so here we are in October 2000 , with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed .
over the past few weeks we have repeatedly scrutinised all the figures , forecasts , and categories of our budget .
we have turned each individual budgetary line inside out , so that the figures we decide on on Thursday are viable , and so that Budget 2001 does not have a fairytale-like quality .
we will submit a budget that accords with the principles of wholly economical budgetary management .
we have been very careful with the European taxpayer &apos; s money , very strict yet still reasonable .
the figures that we , as Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgets , are to put before the House , will not meet - and of course we are a little disappointed about this - with the unanimous support of all our fellow delegates in the specialist committees .
but we set our own rules , and even kept to them and acted in accordance with previously adopted principles .
by the time we had finished , our draft for the first reading could be said to be true to the motto that the art of drawing up a budget is to spread the disappointments evenly .
no doubt it is the Council that has been left most disappointed , but it has absolutely no one but itself to blame for this , indeed it probably deliberately provoked it . how else are we to interpret the Council &apos; s proposal that payments should be increased by a maximum of 3.5 % ?
Parliament , at any rate , understands that the payments to be included in Budget 2001 are a function of the commitments entered into in previous years and those we hope to enter into in 2001 , and we must determine them accordingly .
even the Commission &apos; s estimate of payments for the preliminary draft budget has been very cautious , too cautious as far as we are concerned .
if you look at the budgetary implementation schedules for headings 2 , 3 , 4 and 7 , then you will note that only an average 8 % of all commitments are covered by payments .
quite a number of budgetary lines are not covered at all .
when you then consider that the Commission would concentrate initially on cutting back the amounts outstanding in such a situation , which naturally we would also favour , there would , however , be far too great a risk of not being able to continue with a budgetary line deemed important by Parliament .
it is a mystery to me how , on this basis , the Commission is to preserve the strict relationship between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations , which it is in fact committed to do under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
therefore , in principle , we have raised the payments in headings 3 , 4 and 7 to a level that will ensure 25 % coverage of the commitments to be entered into in 2001 as regards individual budgetary lines .
however , we sometimes asked ourselves during the discussions , how the Council could justify its vote , for example with regard to heading 1 .
when the Commission put forward a proposal , in late spring , to take the EUR 300 million required for the revision of heading 4 from the margin left in heading 1 , the Council vehemently resisted this straightaway .
on no account was the margin to be reduced !
but that did not stop the Council from cutting agricultural expenditure by a total of EUR 555 million .
where is the logic in that ?
essentially , we have reinstated the preliminary draft budget in its entirety .
above all , we want there to be sufficient money available under heading 1B , for the development of rural areas .
there must also be adequate funding available for those areas whose aim it is to achieve a knowledge-based society and to improve the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union .
we took the Commission &apos; s line and increased expenditure for research by 8 % .
what is particularly dear to our hearts though , is something that we have campaigned for from the very outset of this budgetary procedure , i.e. to be able to make an appropriate contribution , through the European budget , to fighting unemployment .
the level of unemployment in Europe is still intolerably high .
countermeasures must be taken against this at every political level ; i.e. at local , regional , national , and I hardly need mention , at European level .
three years ago , we launched our employment initiative , which involved helping small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire risk-bearing capital .
we are all aware that most jobs in Europe are in small and medium-sized enterprises , and that they are the ones that create the most new jobs .
we all know too , that it is no longer all that difficult for high-tech SMEs to acquire capital , because - and our initiative helped bring this about - the capital market situation of these companies has in fact improved considerably .
therefore we want an employment initiative with a slightly different emphasis .
we want to carry on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises , so that they are able to benefit from our common market in exactly the same way that larger companies do .
above all , we want to equip them to make use of the new technologies .
the various instruments we have at our disposal to this end should enable us to succeed in this , whether we are talking in terms of start-up capital , sureties , loan guarantees , or even the joint European venture instrument .
cross-border cooperation between SMUs is precisely what we need to create the European added value we are all always so keen to achieve .
we should therefore continue to deploy this instrument , albeit using simplified procedures , as proposed by the Commission .
we have therefore earmarked almost EUR 120 million for two budgetary lines combined .
if you now take a look at the lines covering labour market measures and local employment initiatives , you will see that a total of almost EUR 150 million has been made available for job creation measures under heading 3 .
that , to my mind , sends out a clear signal .
clearly , we also want to help with the reform of the Commission , and provide support where this has an impact on the staffing situation .
we accept that 400 new posts need to be created , but would attach certain conditions to this .
we expect the Commission to set out , before the second reading , how it intends to implement the Budget more efficiently .
we expect it to explain to us what steps it will take to ensure that Parliament receives better information more quickly , and is kept up-to-date on the implementation of the reform package .
we expect it to step up the efforts it is making to bring the legislative process more into line with the budgetary process .
in addition , naturally we take the view that it would not be acceptable simply to create 400 additional jobs , i.e. on top of those already in existence .
therefore we welcome with open arms the fact that early retirement arrangements have been put in place as part of the reform process .
quite often , the drafting of the Budget is seen as a methodical way of establishing the sad fact that we cannot get by on our revenue .
I believe that is what many of us - i.e. many of you - think when you consider heading 4 of the budget .
after all , we are very poorly provided for when it comes to financing our external policy .
for more than a year now , Parliament has been urging the Council to work with it on negotiating stable and secure reconstruction aid for the Balkans .
the Council has persistently refused to do so .
the people of the Balkans have repeatedly been promised aid by the various Council Summit meetings .
however , back home , the Council shirks from countersigning the promised cheque .
in other contexts , people would say they had been &apos; duped &apos; .
in drawing up its preliminary draft budget in June , not only did the Commission endeavour to secure the financing for the Balkans aid , it also tried not to cut back on the other areas of external policy too heavily .
that is precisely when it did the logical thing and proposed the revision of heading 4 .
but not only did the Council refuse to negotiate with us over a possible revision of this kind , it even went so far , at its first reading , as to reduce the funding for the Balkans , MEDA and TACIS by EUR 200 million , EUR 150 million , and EUR 20 million respectively .
and I have only mentioned the worst of the cuts at that .
this is completely unacceptable !
Parliament will abide by its traditional priorities .
we will make appropriate sums available for those of our budgetary lines concerned with democracy and human rights , cooperation with non-governmental organisations working in the interests of the poorest countries , our cooperation with Latin America , South Africa and Asia .
we will adopt the Council &apos; s proposed level of funding for MEDA , and would urge the Council to join us in using the flexibility instrument , should it become apparent in the course of next year that MEDA requires more money .
but let us return to the Balkans .
our margin will allow us to pitch the level of reconstruction aid EUR 50 million higher than the figure decided by the Council .
add to this our carry-over from Budget 2000 to Budget 2001 under the Notenboom procedure and we will have the amount that the Commission deems appropriate .
following the happy outcome of the elections in Serbia , we are , however , now obliged to support Serbia with financial aid and not just with fine words and grand proclamations .
Parliament &apos; s preferred approach is twofold .
we have created a new budgetary line entitled &apos; democratisation &apos; .
EUR 60 million have been set aside for this purpose , which is money our Budget can easily spare .
but we want to reinforce the point that this is intended for the democratisation process in Serbia .
we have created a second budgetary line entitled &apos; reconstruction &apos; .
we have included a so-called token entry in this .
we urge the Council to join Parliament in weighing up all the possibilities that the Interinstitutional Agreement has to offer , and to set an appropriate level of funding for aid to Serbia .
this is irrespective of the EUR 180 million we transferred last night for emergency aid , for the remainder of the year , because this money has come from the emergency reserve and is only to be used for Humanitarian aid , i.e. to help the Serbs get through the winter during the last few months of the year .
in addition , though , we expect the Council to finally get together with Parliament and take a look at the multiannual allocations , both for MEDA and for cards , and decide on a suitable figure .
we cannot go on like this , slugging it out with one another budget after budget ; always over the same issues , and always going through the same motions .
on Thursday we will adopt a trim , but sensible budget .
all I can say to the Council is : follow our example .
our goal cannot be to diet to the point of collapse .
all too often , weight-consciousness turns into anorexia .
but there is more to a viable and dynamic Union than a supposedly slimline budget .
if we want to command respect on the international stage , strength and competence are the order of the day !
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the budgets of the European Parliament , the Council , the Court of Justice , the Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman , are purely administrative budgets .
however , they provide an insight into how the policies of individual European institutions are translated into concrete action .
as your rapporteur , I have made three guidelines central to my deliberations .
firstly - and this applies to all public budgets - we must make responsible and economical use of our taxpayers &apos; money .
secondly , we must be prepared for the major challenge of enlargement in terms of staffing ; in other words , we must now create the financial leeway we need to be able to rise to this challenge when the time comes .
thirdly , at the end of the day , the taxpayers must get added value for their money .
only then will the European institutions do justice to their task .
following in-depth discussions with the relevant institutions and the honourable Members , whom I would like to thank most sincerely for their excellent and friendly cooperation , I am able to put before you today a draft budget that fully accords with these three guidelines .
with a total of EUR 980 million , the European Parliament &apos; s budget , which I am submitting today , is the largest individual budget .
my efforts were directed at developing delegates &apos; working conditions in such a way as to enable us to master the new challenges in our work arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam .
this Parliament represents the people of Europe .
we are the only institution in Europe that can claim this with complete justification .
hence the administration of this House is there to serve the delegates , and not vice versa .
I believe that through this budget , we have succeeded in turning this consideration into figures and using it to good effect .
scientific preliminary work is one area in particular where there is still plenty of room for improvement in our work .
I hope that the administration will take this up over the next few months and work towards a solution .
we upheld the demands of Parliament &apos; s Bureau as regards the establishment plan , in so far as this could be justified by the Committee on Budgets .
also , in light of the fact that Parliament now has a transparent promotion system , which rewards on the basis of merit and not just according to length of service in a post , we approved all the announced promotions .
the Committee on Budgets supported the necessary increases in funding in the sphere of information technology , especially with regard to data security - where there is a great deal of room for improvement in this House - as well as the increases needed for enhancing the security of our buildings and of all those who work there , and for the legal service .
one point I would like to make very clear is that when it comes to the buildings policy , we are suffering the effect of increased interest rates .
in fact we are directly linked to the interest rate set by the European Central Bank , which is why we have proposed that we should pursue the buildings policy already adopted , because this will help to release us from this burden of interest as soon as possible .
I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank the Vice-President , Mr Gerhard Schmid , who is responsible for budgetary issues , for his constructive cooperation .
I believe that we succeeded , in the course of the conciliation negotiations between the Bureau of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets , in submitting a well-balanced draft .
we have made no change to the Council Budget , as per the agreement between Parliament and the Council .
however , I would also like to take this opportunity to make the Council aware that the Council Budget is a purely administrative budget too .
the Council would do well to ensure that that is how things remain in future , particularly in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
programme expenditure has no place in the Council Budget .
it must be provided for in the Commission Budget on a permanent basis .
being one arm of the budgetary authority , we will continue to keep tabs on this .
the European Court of Auditors is giving us the least cause for concern at present .
the Court of Auditors has honoured the commitments it made of its own volition years ago .
that is why we have released the funds required for the extension of the building of the Court of Auditors .
however , I would also expressly like to point out that we will make very sure that total spending remains within the target of EUR 25 million at 1998 prices .
I believe the European Court of Justice is the one institution that will understand why we should want to keep a suitably close eye on this .
the biggest problem we face at the moment is the hold-ups that have occurred within the translation service of the European Court of Justice .
the consequences of this are no longer to be tolerated , because proceedings at the European Court of Justice now take an average of almost two years , simply because the translation services are no longer able to keep up with the work .
therefore , with effect from the new year , we intend to make a substantial contribution to reducing this translation backlog .
but here too , we will monitor very closely whether any real improvement takes place in the situation at the European Court of Justice .
should this prove not to be the case , we will be forced to take further measures , which will certainly be less kind than those we are proposing for the 2001 financial year
the Economic and Social Committee is still a real problem child .
we want this committee to retain its viability , but it pays the least attention to Parliament &apos; s demands as part of the budgetary authority . this is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue .
we do not just make resolutions to please all those involved , they are supposed to have an impact on the financial management of all the institutions .
the Economic and Social Committee must get its own house in order if it wants to avoid jeopardising its continued existence for good .
I hope that this issue will be tackled courageously over the next few months .
I also hope that the nice Summit will send out a clear signal in this respect .
but it is this committee , in particular , that has follow-up work to do here .
the Committee of the Regions is currently giving less cause for concern .
things are not running quite as smoothly as we imagine them to be there either .
this is another area where our resolutions should be treated with due respect .
a better system is called for , particularly where promotion policy is concerned .
however , as I understand it , one is currently being prepared .
that being the case , I believe we will be in a position to approve the necessary promotions within the Committee of the Regions .
finally , we also handle the Ombudsman &apos; s budget .
we could be relatively restrained here because the Council has in fact already arranged for all the necessary measures to be taken , so that all we have to do in this round is confirm them .
with your permission , I would like to make two closing comments .
it seems to me to be very dangerous to work for one particular institution , because the sickness record is disproportionately high there .
naturally we will have to examine , on the basis of these reports , what measures need to be taken to improve the state of health of the staff in this institution - and I am not talking about Parliament or the Commission - for whom we do , after all , have a special responsibility .
secondly , we suggest that the budgets of both data protection officers - that of the Commission and that of the officer provided for under the Schengen Agreement - should be given separate sections , so that the rights of the budgetary authority are fully upheld and transparency is duly assured on an ongoing basis .
the comprehensive set of figures that I have put before you today , in my capacity as rapporteur , is something to be proud of .
I would be delighted if you could support the Committee on Budget &apos; s proposals when it comes to Thursday &apos; s vote .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ECSC Treaty will expire in June 2002 .
in other words , the year 2001 will see the last full annual budget , and will also form the background to the assessment of the Commission proposal and the proposal that we are in the process of submitting to Parliament .
the Commission has proposed that the appropriations should be increased to EUR 190 million , as compared with EUR 176 million the previous year .
this corresponds , or rather , comes very close to what Parliament proposed during the previous budgetary procedure , i.e. EUR 196 million .
therefore , we emphatically support this proposal , although we feel the breakdown of allocations could be better .
we believe that changes are called for here , and would urge the Commission to look into this .
it is the situation with regard to administrative expenditure that we are most concerned about .
we suggest a cut in redeployment aid , aid for research and social aid , and I intend to be more specific here .
in other words , we do not approve of cuts in the sphere of research .
on the contrary , we feel that there should be increased efforts in research , particularly in view of the candidate countries .
as a result of enlargement , coal production will double and there will be a significant increase in steel production , and we believe therefore , that we urgently need a modernisation and restructuring process .
we must step up our efforts to this end , and we need research into environmentally sustainable technologies .
we suggest that as soon as the ECSC Treaty has expired and the appropriations have been transferred into the EU budget , the candidate countries should be given the opportunity to participate in the coal and steel research financed by the Community , following the example of the Socrates and LEONARDO programmes .
we believe this to be an important proposal , in terms of achieving environmentally sustainable , modernised steel and coal production in Europe , and also with respect to the financing of these areas and the conversion measures .
secondly , we want a review of the relationship between he social measures and the redeployment aid .
the social measures were cut from EUR 31 million to EUR 29 million in the Council &apos; s proposal .
we cannot comprehend this .
we believe that it is imperative for structural redeployment aid to be provided in this area .
the level of employment has dropped from 15 % to 5 % since 1999 , and it is vital that we respond to this .
on the other hand , we do not believe that the redeployment aid can be cut .
its capacity has not been fully exploited in recent years .
in 1999 , for example , only half of the allocation was actually used .
however , the Commission , in making this increase , wants to cover the whole period up to June 2002 .
this seems odd to us because there will still be an operational budget in the second part of 2002 , and so we are calling for a review of the relationship between redeployment aid and social aid .
in addition , we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure .
Parliament has been proposing cuts for a long time now .
in view of the decline in ECSC activities , and the conversion , it is debatable as to whether we can really still justify having an administrative budget of this size .
another important point I would like to make is that once the Treaties have expired , we no longer want a separate regime for the ECSC , but feel that it should be integrated into the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions .
the Commission has echoed this proposal , and we are now prepared to support it .
maintaining a separate entity would entail extra costs without achieving any added value , and instead we should set up a specialised sub-committee operating under the framework of existing EU structures .
furthermore , we propose that Parliament should be kept informed on a regular basis .
in a statement before Parliament in 1973 , the Commission undertook to accept the binding nature of Parliament &apos; s positions with regard to the ECSC .
we expect this commitment to be transferred to the new structures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , two dangers threaten the health of MEPs : heart attacks and attacks of modesty .
I hope , therefore , that you will forgive me if I avoid the latter and describe my short report as extremely important , and express my pleasure at its almost unexpected success with the Commission and the Council .
the report was unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets a few weeks ago and , to date , no amendments have been tabled .
it is to be hoped , therefore , that on Thursday it should in principle be approved without any difficulty .
nonetheless , allow me to explain some of its basic elements .
the proposal I am asking you to support by voting in favour of the report is the result of a long process and fulfils an aspiration that has been held by Parliament almost since its inception .
since 1985 - and I did say 1985 - the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets has been trying to ensure that European Parliament procedures take account of the financial impact of the resolutions voted upon in plenary .
and then , a long time ago , 15 years ago , a working party was set up for that purpose .
we also asked the Council - with what success we do not know - to adopt a similar approach .
although in the Decision of 24 June 1988 on budgetary discipline , the Council established a link between legislation and finance that was subsequently incorporated into the EC Treaty as Article 270 , you will grant me that even the Council itself has not taken great pains to comply with this Decision .
what is the problem , ladies and gentlemen ?
I think I can say that , essentially , the problem is the tremendous increase in legislative work in the European Union as a whole , in particular the exponential growth of legislative codecision , the huge range of legislative decisions taken in parallel .
in accordance with current legislation , the Commission currently sends us , together with its drafts , a balance sheet that includes what is basically a multiannual proposal for budgetary programming corresponding to the draft .
nonetheless , as everyone knows , the human race can be divided into two classes : those who adhere to the budget and those who do not .
this is the trouble with the cars proposal , for example , which is currently under discussion .
when a legislative conciliation takes place on social , cultural or environmental issues - and the Commissioner will recognise that I am right - the Commissioner for Budgets , the Ministers for Finance and the members of the Committee on Budgets all pray that a financial blunder will not occur .
the agreement reached in July involves an increase in the information contained in the financial statement .
in future , all new proposals must be accompanied by an assessment of their compatibility with the financial perspective and its needs with regard to lists of budgetary posts .
the Commission is implicitly required to consider at the beginning of the legislative procedure whether it has the necessary human resources and whether the proposal might require a revision of the financial perspective or a redeployment of previously approved programmes .
in short , an opportunity cost analysis .
many of the problems explained to us by Mrs Haug arise from the fact that the total cost of the programmes exceeds the total amount of the corresponding heading in the financial perspective .
the poor implementation of some programmes can also be explained or justified by a lack of staff .
Commissioner Patten thus proposes reducing the cost of the MEDA programme and simultaneously increasing its staff by 25 posts .
this is a prime example of what we are trying to avoid a priori .
we are therefore also going to change our internal Rules of Procedure in order to take account of this agreement .
we believe that this declaration should be included in the Interinstitutional Agreement , but in any case , I would like to say to you that it only makes sense within the context of an Interinstitutional Agreement with a financial perspective .
I shall end , Mr President , by thanking the other institutions for their diligence in the handling of this joint declaration .
Parliament reiterated its suggestion during a three-way dialogue that took place halfway through the Portuguese Presidency and concluded with an agreement at the first conciliation presided over by France in July .
this is a real record , which I hope will now lead to greater consideration of the financial constraints in our legislative activities .
thank you , Mr Colom i Naval .
Modesty has prevented you from ending the list of rapporteurs with your own name .
it is now my great pleasure to welcome to this Chamber a brand new minister from my country , who will be speaking in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , budgetary policy always requires foresight , and today we are discussing Budget 2001 , the budget for next year , and so together we must decide what demands there will be on European policy and the European budget next year , which we will need to fulfil , and what challenges we will face there .
the European budget will be under considerable pressure next year .
you only have to think of agricultural policy , where , for the first time , the Berlin decisions will cost Europe more dearly . I might point out that , fortunately , we will at last be able to approve the programmes for promoting development in rural areas , in other words , this new programme will be fully up and running next year .
we are in a similar situation as regards structural policy .
the programmes for the new assistance period 2000-2006 have now been approved for practically all the Member States , and so we can expect , and also hope , that the first projects of the operational programmes can be implemented next year , which will require an appropriate level of funding to be made available in the budget .
on the enlargement front , there are new programmes for boosting pre-accession aid and reform .
the deadline for enlargement is hopefully drawing closer , but of course this also means that pressure is building on the candidate states to undertake reforms , which is of course where the pre-accession aid comes in .
most importantly of all - and this has been underlined repeatedly - we face new challenges in foreign policy , and , needless to say , also new opportunities to improve our relations with our neighbours , and particularly those in the Balkans , and to promote stability there .
these are the huge challenges facing European policy , the budget , and the Commission &apos; s administration , whose job it is to execute these tasks , and here too we need to boost resource levels .
we are also called upon to exercise budgetary discipline in our management of European finances .
we must practise what we preach to the Member States , and it is bringing all these strands together that makes budgetary policy so exciting , as all those who are involved would testify .
this entails weighing up the various interests , negotiations between institutions , and we are now at the discussion stage of Budget 2001 . that is to say , all the institutions - i.e. Parliament , the Council and the Commission with its preliminary draft budget - have put forward their first proposals and decisions on Budget 2001 .
if you look at these three different sets of figures , you will see that there are still considerable discrepancies , in purely quantitative terms but obviously as regards content too .
I will just give you a brief illustration of this : the Commission has proposed an allocation of EUR 96.9 billion in the way of commitment appropriations , the Council has proposed EUR 95.9 billion , the European Parliament EUR 96.8 billion , and when it comes to payments there is a discrepancy between Parliament &apos; s proposed figure and that of the Council , of almost EUR 2.2 billion .
this means that quantitatively speaking , there is a relatively large gap to be bridged here . but I might also emphasise that the proposals , or rather , decisions of all three institutions in respect of Budget 2001 , fall below the threshold set during the financial planning in Berlin .
it is therefore quite fair to say that all the institutions have endeavoured to keep within these limits , and to maintain budgetary discipline .
I must point out that the Berlin decisions would allow for a 6.1 % increase in payments as compared with the previous year , and no decision proposes an increase on that scale .
in other words , there is still plenty of room for negotiation , and anyone who attended the trialogue between Parliament , the Council and the Commission last week , will confirm that real efforts are being made to reach a satisfactory solution , and the atmosphere speaks of a genuine willingness to negotiate , rather than quarrel .
I would like to take this opportunity to say a special word of thanks to Parliament and to the rapporteurs , Mrs Haug , Mr Ferber , Mrs R√ºhle and Mr Colom i Naval .
I would also like to thank the Council , particularly for last Wednesday &apos; s brilliant achievement - Mr Patria - in the trialogue .
the conciliation process which took place in the summer - Mr Colom i Naval made this point - had a positive outcome too , in that , in future , there will be an increase in the information made available to Parliament , and all new legislative proposals must be accompanied by an estimate of their compatibility with the financial forecasts .
on behalf of the Commission , I can fully support your proposals , Mr Colom , because Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgets bears a weighty responsibility , and has the task of keeping an eye on whether the Committee on Budgets is indeed using these new instruments , so as to help ensure that financially viable decisions are taken .
nor should we have to contend with things of the kind that have gone on recently in the Council , for example when the agricultural ministers rejected a cost-cutting proposal from the Council , i.e. they voted for higher expenditure and then the Council of Finance Ministers reduced expenditure in the agricultural sector .
I would therefore point out that the decisions taken must be backed up with adequate funding .
the reason for this of course , is that rather than add to the backlog , we must endeavour to reduce it , although this entails having the right human resources in place in the Commission .
that is why the Commission decided to submit a request for 400 new posts with this budget .
I would again draw your attention to the fact that we did not do so until we had conducted a critical survey of all the departments in order to assess whether there was still scope for redeploying staff , and only then did we reach the conclusion that we must approach the budgetary authority with a request for new posts .
I would like to thank the Council for their positive vote on this issue .
Parliament has now placed the posts in reserve , and naturally I fully accept , Mrs Haug , that there are conditions attached to their release . however , I would you to take account of the fact that these must be conditions we can actually fulfil .
one of the conditions imposed was that the comitology procedure must be changed .
I would point out at this juncture that following a long debate last year , a new decision was taken on the comitology procedure , in conjunction with the Council , and I hold out little hope of us being able to reopen this debate .
exactly the same applies to the condition stipulating that provision must be made for a performance reserve as a matter of priority .
if we want to improve - and that is our aim where the performance reserve is concerned - then of course we will need those posts .
we will go to great lengths to explain to you what steps we have taken on the reform front , reform measures we have instigated , what initiatives are well underway , and what other plans we have in the pipeline , so as to demonstrate that the Commission , for its part , is pulling out all the stops .
but I would also urge Parliament to be prepared to negotiate in these matters .
the greatest challenge facing those responsible for budgetary policy , in the year to come , or rather , at the present moment , is that financing must be secured for new foreign policy tasks , and this mainly concerns the financing for the necessary stabilisation aid in the Balkans .
I would remind you that the financial plan for the Balkans agreed last year only made provision for EUR 1.85 billion for the entire period up to 2006 .
this decision was taken under completely different conditions on the European policy front than we are now experiencing , I am glad to say , following the changeover of power in Belgrade .
I might also point out that last year , for instance , we had a long debate here with the Council , in connection with the reconstruction measures for Kosovo , on whether we stood any chance at all of putting in a good performance out there .
fortunately , the reconstruction agency has implemented the Kosovo reconstruction aid to extremely good effect , which means we are now in a position to be able to increase the appropriations for the reconstruction agency this year by EUR 175 million , and I would like to extend sincere thanks to the Committee on Budgets , and particularly the chairman , Mr Wynn , for supporting these measures in this way .
above all , by increasing aid for Kosovo in this way , before the end of this year , it will be immediately apparent - and this is a very important political message to my mind - that the European Union does not take the view that because there has now been a changeover of power in Serbia , we should cut back on aid to Kosovo .
no , we cannot have Kosovo fall victim to this a second time .
on the contrary , we need to fulfil both tasks .
the question of financial aid for Serbia next year and for subsequent years , is now on the table of course .
the question as to whether the necessary measures can be carved from the previous package for the Mediterranean programme , is a political and not a technical issue .
EUR 8.1 billion were earmarked for the MEDA programme in the Berlin financial planning .
if this were to be trimmed down to EUR 5 or 6 billion then it would not be possible to continue financing the same policies .
of course the question that needs to be answered is : what kind of policy do we want the European Union to pursue in our southerly neighbouring states ?
the Commission does not believe that all the reconstruction aid required for the Balkans should be carved out of the funds for the MEDA programme .
we have various instruments at our disposal for budgetary policy , in the event that unforeseen tasks should arise , or even additional requirements .
they are known as the flexibility reserve .
I have taken on board the fact that the Council believes there is willingness to negotiate .
I am aware that Parliament is of the opinion that the flexibility reserve should be employed forthwith , in order to offset the cuts in the MEDA programme .
to that I would say : the flexibility reserve is an instrument available to us for financing an unforeseen task in a particular year .
the issue of Balkans aid does not come under this heading because it is a multiannual task .
we also have the negative reserve instrument available to us in the course of the budgetary procedure .
then there is the instrument whereby expenditure is increased in category IV , and there is a corresponding evening out across the whole budget . we also have the revision instrument , or rather the financial planning can be amended .
naturally , certain conditions are laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement , but it does not specify that the flexibility reserve has to be the first port of call .
there is no mention of this , instead provision is made for certain steps to be taken .
I can assure you that the Commission has taken these steps , and I would remind you that this is supposed to give us a clear idea of the kind of timeframe we are looking at .
as to the question as to whether it will be possible to reallocate funds from agricultural policy , we will see that you get the latest forecasts on agricultural expenditure in the near future .
of course revising the financial perspective is not an end in itself , rather , the Commission proposed this method with a view to financing the necessary expenditure in foreign policy , so as to do justice to the challenges we face .
I would again urge you - the Commission is leaving your proposal on the table - to examine this proposal without bias and consider it as a possibility .
the European Union promised Serbia before the elections that in the event of a change in the balance of power , and a return to democracy , it would deliver emergency aid .
we have given our word and we will all keep our word .
the Commission submitted a proposal to activate the emergency reserve to this end , and put together an aid package .
these are the tasks that the aid package is designed to accomplish , and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament and the Council most sincerely for being so quick to support this proposal and for being prepared to take this decision so rapidly .
I believe that in this way , the European Union has proved beyond all doubt that it is able to take very swift joint action , and that here too , there is evidence of a common will being translated into action , a common will to do our utmost to secure political stability - and that means peace - in Europe .
Mr President , it was splendid to hear the Commissioner &apos; s criticism of the Council when it comes to foreign policy .
when we see a dictatorship in the Balkans superseded by the hope of democracy , we cannot lock ourselves into disputes about the Budget . instead , the budget frameworks , - the so-called financial perspective - must be adjusted .
we cannot simply take all the money from other areas of foreign policy .
we have already this year exceeded the foreign policy budget by 400 million .
let us now be far-sighted enough to give the Commission the opportunity to plan ahead .
circumstances have also revealed the need for the so-called &apos; rapid reaction facility &apos; , as proposed by the Commission .
the money must not be placed in the reserves with the risk of the Council &apos; s blocking it , something which would of course lead to the Commission &apos; s not being able to plan ahead .
remember Romano Prodi &apos; s major speech in this Chamber a few weeks ago .
we shall support his and Chris Patten &apos; s attempt to strengthen the Commission &apos; s effectiveness by means of parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary control to which the Council and Mr Solana are not of course subject .
I should therefore ask both the Council and the Committee on Budgets here in Parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy .
BudgetaryControl . the Committee on Budgetary Control considered tabling a number of amendments to this year &apos; s budget , looking at the implementation figures of the current and previous years budgets alongside the corresponding analysis contained within the revenue and expenditure account and balance sheet .
we also looked at the Court of Auditors &apos; special reports .
whilst these are drawn up pursuant to Article 248 ( 4 ) of the Treaty for the purpose of discharge , we actually think there is some value in our committee and the Committee on Budgets looking into them and looking at how the money is being spent in the current year in areas where the Court of Auditors found problems in the past .
looking at the evaluation reports , the Commission has produced a lot of documentation concerning the preliminary draft budget , for example for 2001 , which included a working document presenting summaries of results of a number of mostly external evaluations .
those were carried out at the request of the Commission itself and referred to the financial year 1999 , the most recent one for which the final data was available .
the material was obviously useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge .
so the committee would like to recommend to all the specialised committees concerned to take into account the results of those evaluations .
in the end we tabled a very short paper to the Committee on Budgets with a number of recommendations which we hope will be taken on board .
the House will no doubt be aware that I personally have taken an interest in the budget and tabled a number of amendments .
I look forward in the future to seeing roughly the same sort of exercise and trying to get rid of a number of very small and more insignificant budget lines , as well as making this House and the Commission much more efficient , do less and do it better .
Mr President , as draftsman for the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , I have no problem asking this House to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets on the initiative of either our committee or the general rapporteur , Mrs Haug .
I observe , in particular , that following our requests , the Committee on Budgets has proposed a substantial increase in the credits made available to the European Fund for refugees , funds which the Council had rather imprudently , not to say rather stupidly , cut .
I should also like to point out and to endorse the very clear increase in appropriations earmarked for funding measures to combat and prevent discrimination . this has been a priority of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole since the Treaty of Amsterdam .
finally , I am delighted to note that , in the field for which my own committee is responsible , no less than four new budget lines have been proposed for our approval .
the first of these is for the implementation of a pilot project intended to fund an information campaign within the fifteen Member States against the criminal scourge of paedophilia .
the second is for aid to victims of human rights violations in need of treatment in specialised institutions .
the third is intended to fund measures in preparation for a programme to combat drugs trafficking , and the fourth sets up the funding for actions to be carried out conjointly with third countries , primarily Morocco , with a view to better controlling the flow of immigration .
let me express just one regret , in conclusion .
the Committee on Budgets did not see fit to adopt my own committee &apos; s proposal to increase the resources to be made available to the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia based in Vienna .
I think this is a mistake which must be set right .
at a time when racist and xenophobic acts are gaining ground , scandalously , in a number of European Union countries , I think it crucial to boost the financial means needed to set up a technically reliable network for the collation of information throughout the Union .
I think that , were they to support this amendment , my fellow Members would be setting in place a technically fair and politically timely act .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the vote in the Committee on Budgets was rather unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
firstly , I understand why people want to give the Commission a grilling on its information policy .
many delegates feel that the Commission &apos; s information policy , particularly where PRINCE is concerned , has not brought the success people were expecting .
in addition , the Commission &apos; s promise to work closely with Parliament on this issue has left a great deal to be desired .
in many Member States , where the Commission operates information bureaux , it is not possible to reach a broad cross-section of the public through holding conferences for experts .
however , using the reserve instrument to impose a total blockade , is not the right way to go about things either .
in view of the fact that euro banknotes and coins are to be introduced in 2002 , I cannot accept the decision to place the appropriations from PRINCE in the reserve in financial year 2001 .
when could be a better moment to invest in information campaigns on the euro , given that uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate losses between the dollar and the euro , and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins , has never been so high ?
in view of the shortcomings of previous information campaigns , we could , if need be , accept a 50 % reserve by way of compromise , so as to give the Commission the opportunity to lend an innovative approach to its information strategy , or give it fresh impetus .
secondly , I see people have been fighting tooth and nail over the mini budgets in the A30 lines .
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has requested expert reports on this , with a view to receiving appropriate advice from the European Central Bank on the financial aspect .
should a compromise solution be reached on this issue in the time remaining , which supports the important work undertaken by the EMAC Committee , then we can arrange things accordingly , otherwise our committee will keep an open mind on the matter .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is a Community of law , because European law is observed and upheld .
the European Court of Justice takes care of that .
in so doing , it has made a considerable contribution to the success of the whole integration project over the last forty years .
the European courts are currently facing major obstacles in their efforts to uphold European law , because they do not have the necessary funding available to them .
there are 1600 cases pending before the European Court of Justice , and the backlog in translation work runs to 120 000 pages .
as such , the European Court of Justice has become a sticking point for legal certainty .
in fact , back at first reading , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens &apos; right to see their European laws upheld , and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law , on account of delays .
I am extremely grateful to the Committee on Budgets and the competent rapporteur for endorsing this line of argument and supporting our proposals .
in particular , we will again recommend , at second reading , that 60 new posts be created at the European Court of Justice , and , in addition , that the necessary funding be made available in the budget .
we also propose that EUR 3 million be set aside , with immediate effect , in order to enlist the services of freelance translators .
in implementing these measures , we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order , restore people &apos; s faith in the legal certainty of the EU , and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law .
Mr President , this is my first year in the European Parliament and I have been struck during the course of this budget debate by the contrast between rhetoric and delivery .
last year when we were discussing the budget , we had politicians in the Member State governments who were posturing on the issue of renewable energy , whilst at the same time proposing major cuts to the save programme in this Parliament .
I found that to be a curious position .
but here we are yet again , twelve months later , in a situation in which ministers from Member State governments have come out of summits , preening themselves over their ambitious targets for research , while the draft budget prepared by the Council makes total cuts in payment appropriations in the research subsection of the fifth Framework Programme of no less than EUR 100 million .
so there really is a stark difference between delivery on the part of the Council , and the rhetoric that the Council uses .
my committee has mandated me to make that point and we will certainly , in a sense of discipline , be aiming to see at least one half of that cut in payment appropriations being restored in the plenary vote .
I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Haug on the work done in the Committee on Budgets , particularly the work done to restore lines in relation to small- and medium-sized enterprises , again cut by the Council .
that has been a priority of our committee and a priority of this Parliament .
again , it is difficult to reconcile the rhetoric of the Council with its proposals in that area .
the proposals put forward by our committee and supported by the Committee on Budgets are much better .
it would take more than the one minute I have left if I were to go into all of my committee &apos; s views in relation to the MEDA programme .
we know the difficulties .
Commissioner Patten has outlined them to us , but there is important work to be undertaken within the area of the MEDA programme .
we only have to look at our television sets to see the difficulties in the Middle East to be reminded of that each and every day .
I am also the draftsman for my committee on Mrs R√ºhle &apos; s report on the ECSC budget .
let me briefly touch on a number of items there .
we are of the view that there should be much more emphasis on developing research .
I saw that strain in her report as well .
we want to see it increased by 10 % .
the priorities should be clean technology , environmental protection and remediation and safety for the future .
Mrs R√ºhle agrees with me on that , so again in that area there is consensus within this Parliament which , I am bound to say , all too sadly is not often shared by the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it makes no sense at all to me .
they decide , in Lisbon , to do their level best to return to full employment as soon as possible , they lament the fact that there is social exclusion , and they profess to want to tackle all forms of discrimination , yet when it comes to drafting the budget , it all gets swept aside by the Commission and the Council .
our citizens , not to mention this House , have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service .
we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs favour a thrifty budget too , but not in this way .
it fills me with confidence that together , we have managed to save our employment initiative for local engagement , which was launched last year , because this is the initiative that supports new employment policy measures at local level , whilst involving all players , NGOs included .
the Commission &apos; s attempt to abolish this initiative showed out-and-out disregard for the political will of Lisbon and the priorities of this House .
I also welcome the fact that , in future , we will aim to do more for health and safety protection in the workplace again .
the new initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises will illustrate best practice in this sphere , and lend added value accordingly .
naturally we would have liked to see the action programmes for combating social exclusion and discrimination better provided for , so as not to disappoint the expectations that Article 13 has given rise to amongst the public , and also the NGOs .
but then every committee has simply had to accept compromises on that score .
however , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs feels there is a more serious problem still to be addressed , namely that the budget makes no provision whatsoever for the observatory for industrial change .
therefore I say again to all those who denigrate this project : firstly , no one wants a new , expensive agency .
instead , the agency in Dublin should only be entrusted with the relevant tasks .
secondly , the observation point &apos; s task would be to collect information , so as to assist the process of industrial change .
no more and no less .
anyone who maintains that part of its job would be to block mergers or halt globalisation , does so for purely polemical reasons .
and so I hope that when it comes to tomorrow &apos; s vote , we will still achieve the majority required for the observation point in Dublin
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment on this year &apos; s budget , I want to acknowledge the difficult framework in which it has been constructed and the serious pressures upon all of us .
I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , in trying to resolve some very difficult questions this year because of the immense pressures that have been brought to bear upon the budget at a very late stage .
we must have the courage of our convictions and insist upon finding the very modest finance needed to fulfil our key objectives .
in that regard , I would draw the Commission &apos; s and the House &apos; s attention to the following issues .
the first is the decision by the Committee on Budgets to place into reserve the monies agreed for the Life programme .
this was an astonishing decision and left many of us feeling that this whole very important programme had simply become a football in a game between the Budgets Committee and the Commission .
it demonstrated that those bodies did not recognise the importance of this programme to the environment .
we need to reverse that decision in the vote this week in the House and make those funds immediately available , because there is an enormous demand for their utilisation .
the treatment by the Budgets Committee of several agencies has been proven to be unfair and unjust this year and in past years , in particular the refusal to increase monies to the Drugs Agency .
if it is supported by the House this week , it will put a stop to the recently begun programme for the approval of orphan drugs for rare diseases .
unless that funding is restored in a vote this week in Parliament , I would anticipate a very serious situation arising and considerable distress to many people in Europe .
a similar injustice has been done to the Environment Agency , given its increased workload as a result of enlargement .
in future years a more thoughtful , consistent and sensitive approach to the financial needs of the agencies will be needed and I hope the approach of treating them all the same , which has prevailed in previous years , will now be dropped .
they are the main objectives of the Environment Committee .
they can be achieved with an absolutely minuscule amount of finance .
it is the duty of the House to give those points their support in the vote this week , to demonstrate its continued commitment to protecting the environment and improving public health .
Mr President , on behalf of my Committee , I would like to make a few observations , starting with rural policy .
the agriculture committee subscribes to the Berlin Agreement , also with regard to rural policy , but notes at the same time that spending is suffering delays , and we have established that in a number of cases , vis-√†-vis the Council and Member States , the limits of what is possible are being tested with regard to the agricultural funds .
that is a pity ; it would be preferable if , in spending the budget , the actual objective were achieved , namely if the switch were made from countryside to multifunctionality and greater market orientation .
I wanted to share this observation with the Council , in particular .
the second point I wanted to make relates to the budget for agriculture and horticulture .
it is reported to have increased by 6 % , partly due to the switch-over .
I have to add , however , that sugar policy , for example , is now again the topic of debate , also within the Commission .
I should in any event like to urge the Commission to support Commissioner Fischler in this respect , for the best way to stay within the financial limits is not to put the future of sugar policy at risk again , at least not before 2006 .
the third point pertains to European agricultural policy as it is now before us in the budget proposals .
we have noted that although it may be focused on the social objective , it is , as a result , biased slightly too much in favour of the home market , in contrast to , for example , the power pattern which has unfolded in the United States and Australia , which is mainly aimed at greater market access , and into which a great deal of money is pumped .
the budget per farm in the United States is currently three times higher than in Europe .
that means that as far as the course which we are setting for the budget is concerned , the question is whether market orientation should not be given a higher profile .
Commissioner Fischler has set the tone for this on a number of occasions .
this could be further developed but requires collaboration from the Council as an absolute necessity .
this also means that , with regard to the European agricultural budget , namely multifunctionality and rural development , consideration must also be given to landscape and animal welfare , and that close collaboration in those areas is needed .
in fact , there is room for improvement here too , for example with regard to the tobacco policy .
in conclusion , the agriculture committee is of the opinion that we should remain within the confines of the Berlin Agreement , and as such , I , as draftsman of the opinion have to advise against Amendment No 206 with regard to the vote in this Parliament .
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries .
( ES ) Mr President , I join some of my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Haug on her report .
I know that it has not been easy and we therefore thank her even more , if possible , for her work .
the common fisheries policy , ladies and gentlemen , represents a very small part of the Community budget : we are talking about barely a billion euros .
the Committee on Fisheries , which shares with the Commission the principle of budgetary stringency , has accepted the limits set by the latter in its preliminary draft and has indicated its concerns in certain budget headings .
we have asked an indicative appropriation of EUR 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the CFP .
an information campaign disseminating the principle on which the CFP is based - the sustainable exploitation of marine resources - is essential .
quality products must be highlighted , conservation standards , such as the observation of minimum fish sizes , must be circulated and we must explain to consumers the health benefits of eating fish .
the Committee on Fisheries has approved another amendment increasing the appropriations intended for controlling and observing fishing activities in Community and third-country waters .
we have criticised the shortcomings and the marginal role of the Commission in the policy of control and observation and we therefore believe that this policy must be supported with an increased budget .
the primary aim of the Committee on Fisheries &apos; petitions is to improve the CFP &apos; s potential for maintaining and creating employment .
whilst employment may be the European Union &apos; s priority policy , fisheries , as another economic sector , cannot remain on the sidelines .
the CFP is tremendously important for maintaining employment in the peripheral regions , which are very dependent on fishing .
our priorities are , and must be , to consolidate and increase international fishing agreements and to improve safety and working conditions within the sector and conserve resources .
the cheapest jobs , ladies and gentlemen , are those that do not need to be created because they have not been lost .
it is better to support activities that already generate jobs than to have to invest vast amounts later in creating new industries .
in conclusion , I would particularly like to mention a topic with regard to which Parliament is to issue its assent .
I am referring to the fisheries agreement with Morocco .
the Committee on Fisheries asks that line B7-8000 should include an entry of EUR 125 million to cover the financing of this agreement for the year 2001 .
all parties must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations .
the Commission in its executive capacity must negotiate with weighty arguments to achieve a reasonable agreement with Morocco and the Council and the governments concerned should provide a political impetus for this negotiation .
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , for her excellent work in preparing the draft budget .
she sat in on our committee and , to her credit , took our committee &apos; s proposals into consideration .
the goal of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is to improve the employment rate particularly by supporting SMEs and exploiting the opportunities offered by the information Society .
the committee stresses the importance of good and disciplined financial management , the simplification of administrative procedures , and the successful outcome of projects .
our committee supports the Commission &apos; s proposals and rejected the Council &apos; s cuts to payment appropriations saying they were unjustified .
our aim is to deal promptly with the arrears and get the new programmes swiftly and effectively under way .
the focus with regard to traffic is on the development of the trans-European transport network .
only symbolic appropriations are earmarked for transport safety , sustainable transport systems and combined goods transport .
I would hope for an improvement to this situation in the years to come , as the accident rate varies from one Member State to another to a surprising extent , and , for example , there should be more exchange of ideas when it comes to good transport practice .
the Community should also be investing in developing travel and tourism , particularly by supporting SMEs in this field .
our committee believes that the Commission should table a new proposal for a programme to support travel and tourism .
support from ISPA , which is designed for preparations for enlargement , should be used to part-finance the launching of projects , so that limited resources can be used effectively .
Mr President , right at the start I would like to thank Jutta Haug , as budget rapporteur , for the cooperation she demonstrated in dealing with appropriations relating to culture , youth , education and communication in the budget .
I am especially glad that we have been able to safeguard financing for the Socrates , Youth and Culture 2000 programmes that were decided at the end of last year .
the Committee on Budgets has also shown understanding with regard to financing the Media plus programme , which is still open .
hopefully we will rapidly achieve harmony between the Council and Parliament .
the success of audio-visual production is an important part of the European strategy .
I am sorry , however , that the Committee on Budgets voted to enter in the reserve Commission appropriations for information activities .
hopefully this problem will be put right in plenary .
very little has been allocated to culture in the budget .
in all the EU spends just under two euros for each citizen on training , youth exchange programmes , culture projects , and support and information with regard to audio-visual production .
on the other hand , almost a billion euros have been set aside for premiums for tobacco production , i.e. nearly three times as much as for the Socrates , Youth and Culture 2000 programmes put together .
in its discussion of the budget , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport has , as so often at other times , been worried about budget payments management .
decisions on applications for support have taken a long time and payments have been delayed .
we have to find a remedy for this .
the citizens of the Union must receive a good , efficient service .
that is vital for the programme aims to succeed but also for the legitimacy of the EU .
direct support via class A policies for national and cultural organisations , which pursue European interests , this time too aroused passion , despite the modest amount of the support .
we in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport tried to remain within the framework of the proposed appropriations , so that we ourselves might set out priorities as befits a special committee .
we were not entirely successful in this .
neither has the Committee on Budgets completely honoured our priorities , but it did , happily , increase appropriations slightly .
it is important to see that the Committee on Budgets took a positive attitude towards the request of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport to have the Commission give an account of the financing of organisations hitherto , so that we might establish fairer and more open rules for this .
I wish , furthermore , to turn our attention to the financing of Euronews .
both the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport and the Committee on Budgets think it important to guarantee that the financing stay at its present level .
I hope that the will of Parliament will be taken into consideration in talks between the Commission and Euronews .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the budget determines the image of Europe and is the exponent par excellence of the European Union &apos; s priorities .
it is by means of the budget that the European Parliament can and must realise its ideals .
unfortunately , year after year , Member States have passed on most of their responsibilities of providing aid to Bosnia and Kosovo to the European Union .
each time , this was at the expense of European aid to the poorest countries .
year after year , Parliament has protected the interests of the poorest countries in the European budget , and with moderate success , even though this has not been enough .
the European Commission struggled to come to terms with the extension of priorities , and this has led to unacceptable gaps in the implementation of commitments which were made under pressure of ever larger budgets for support to foreign aid and cooperation operations .
today , we are viewing the 2001 budget with the Serbian population very much at the forefront of our minds .
there is no doubt that Europe has to make a crucial contribution to the reconstruction of Serbia , and hence to the stabilisation of the Balkans .
the wish for peace and cooperation stability is of historic importance .
but Europe itself is responsible for what is required to integrate Serbia in the democratic world .
we cannot and must not present the bill for this to the poorest countries .
Europe , operating today as a global player , must also do its bit to reduce poverty .
this is not a situation in which we can opt for &apos; either-or &apos; ; it is a &apos; both-and &apos; situation , i.e. both aid to Serbia and the Balkans , and aid to the poorest countries .
what does this translate into in terms of the 2001 budget ?
even in 1999 , as much as EUR 3.2 million was refunded to the Member States because those resources were not spent .
even our most generous estimates of what will be required for Kosovo and Serbia in 2001 will not exceed the EUR 3.2 million , far from it .
so we have the means .
the issue of the budget can thus be reduced to a purely political issue , and in subsequently weighing up the political options in an honest manner , the effectiveness of aid needs to be explored .
if we do not want to pursue symbolic policies , we need to think and act in a result-oriented manner .
in the final analysis , it is not about what we budget for , but rather about whether our money ends up at the right place and with the impact we had envisaged .
this is where we hit a major problem .
for years , the Commission has been unable to spend the funds we have budgeted for .
for example , with regard to our aid to Mediterranean countries , we have a backlog which has accumulated over many years of budgets .
the Commission is now working on activity-based budgeting , which will enable us to prevent these problems from happening again .
in essence , activity-based budgeting should mean that for each budget line which is set up , the means are determined which are necessary to actually implement that budget line .
once we have assured ourselves that what we budget for can actually be spent , we will subsequently need to ask ourselves whether the aid actually ends up where it is needed the most .
I am of the opinion that we need to make a mental switch .
the budget which we determine mutually , must reflect our priorities , must be understandable to the citizen and must also be goal-oriented .
we have therefore proposed that , where relevant , we should include concrete output targets in our budget lines .
these will indicate what sectors , in our eyes , must benefit directly from the aid which is budgeted for in certain regions .
this is why we have ensured that the aid for education and health care is doubled , and that is necessary to ensure that the aid ends up with the people who need it the most .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , I would like to ask for Parliament &apos; s support so that the amendments already approved by the Committee on Budgets may be definitively approved .
they are not exactly what we had asked for , since in some cases the amount we had requested has been reduced but , on the whole , we are satisfied because we believe that there will be continuing concern to facilitate the promotion of women and equal opportunities by the following means :
information initiatives for the common agricultural policy - where women play an extremely important role , without recognition for their work - through the EQUAL programme which is intended to make it easier to employ women within the Community strategy for equal opportunities . this is the report that we examined yesterday and which , sadly , has been referred back to committee today .
secondly , the incorporation of women into the information society , which is extremely important for the future ; financial assistance for women in Central and Eastern European countries , in the MEDA countries ; the fight against sex tourism in third countries , where there is a huge problem which affects women in particular ; and the promotion and defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of women .
we must also bear in mind that all this is related to the fight against domestic violence , which is taking place under the DAPHNE programme .
all in all , we would like to see these amendments approved .
we hope that this will be the case .
I would like to cite another amendment related to women &apos; s organisations : the committee approved an amount for the European Women &apos; s lobby .
a group of MEPs then presented an amendment to the Committee on Budgets - which was approved - with a view to extending this budget heading to other women &apos; s organisations in order to show our pluralist approach and respect for all options and all political affiliations in the European Union .
we also hope that this heading will be approved .
for this budget heading we in the committee had asked for a larger amount than was allocated in the end , but all in all , as I said before , we are satisfied and we are hoping for final approval .
Mr President , in previous years &apos; debates I spoke for the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , where we heard from Mrs Iivari this afternoon .
very little money indeed is spent .
I totally support the remarks made by Mrs Iivari which draw attention to that problem .
I speak this year for the Committee on Petitions , where we spend even less money , indeed hardly any money at all .
maybe that is as it should be .
certainly as the budget rapporteur I commend the good relations we have had with Mr Ferber .
in speaking this afternoon I commend to the House those budget lines that are dedicated to the work of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman .
a prime responsibility of any elected parliament is to protect the interests of the individual citizens against the executive .
in our case we have to ensure not only that the Commission respects European policy but that the Member States do so as well and fulfil their Treaty obligations .
they are not always ready to do so .
there are no better guardians of the Treaties than the European citizens .
an important way that the citizens can ensure that their concerns are addressed is by appealing either to the Ombudsman or petitioning Parliament .
it is a cheap process for us ; for the citizen it is free .
compare that to redress through the courts of law .
I urge the House to see that the Ombudsman has adequate staff to do his job properly and the Petitions Committee has adequate tools to do its job properly .
in particular , this year we have asked - and I believe we will have the support of the House - to ensure that there is adequate money to see that we have a proper interactive database so that Members , staff and citizens can address their concerns and see how they are progressing through Parliament .
there has already been good progress .
at the moment it is just the citizens who cannot access the database .
I hope they will very quickly have that possibility .
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the issue we are petitioned on is the question of fraud and mismanagement of money in the European Union .
we need to be aware of that .
but I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends just 1 % of GDP and much of that is administered in the Member States .
if we are looking for waste and fraud , it is not just found within the European Union .
in just one month I have found those cases .
only last weekend we learned that General Abacha of Nigeria laundered GBP 4.5 billion through the banks in London without the proper authorities knowing about it .
so certainly we must make sure that we have our affairs in order in Europe but anybody reporting these issues should never forget that it is not just the European Union that needs to address those issues seriously .
Mr President , I would like to start by giving my warmest congratulations to our two rapporteurs who have prepared our debates today on behalf of our committee .
they have both done an excellent job for us and I know it is not easy to coordinate the position of others , having been a rapporteur myself .
the context of our debate today is that we must use whatever opportunity we have in our budget to make sure that our European institutions are ready for the next stage of enlargement , both in terms of the institutions &apos; structures as well as improved policy management .
I turn first to Parliament &apos; s budget .
our rapporteur , Mr Ferber , was absolutely right that we should avoid placing posts in reserve in view of enlargement at this stage - the motto should be &quot; more haste , less speed &quot; .
we in Parliament should coordinate with the other two institutions on what we should be doing in terms of enlargement for translation , interpretation , buildings and personnel and we should work out a joint plan between us .
our administration should be very prudent about the linguistic sector .
we are after all thinking of enlargement for ten countries and not just five so we need to take a broader view .
secondly , I have a specific comment on category 4 and on our external policies .
we know that our debates on the budget will address this on many occasions .
but I would like to pick up on the comments of the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , who said that there are a number of instruments , a number of means by which we can come to terms with what is requested for this year , whether it be the flexibility instrument or indeed the negative reserve , where we could perhaps find the credits available for this year despite the problem of how to manage that in practice .
we must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective .
but of course my group will be at one in saying we must resolve this problem as soon as possible so as to give a long-term perspective of how the European Union &apos; s aid is going to be used in MEDA and in cards .
let me turn to the overall strategy .
this is the first budget debate for a considerable time without a substantive issue of dispute between Parliament and Commission .
the framework agreement between our two institutions is now in operation even if it is disputed by a few of our Members .
no discharge is outstanding , the reform process started by the last Commission under the strong urgings of our Parliament has been taken up in earnest by this Commission .
some progress has been made but there is a long way to go .
it is this background which is crucial to my group &apos; s approach to the 2001 budget .
we focussed our efforts on three specific areas : better execution of the budget , more effective management of European policies and successful implementation of the reform package with particular reference to the new posts requested by the Commission .
before coming to that , a word on the position of the British Conservatives .
to the surprise of many in my delegation , we established a core strategy unanimously at the beginning of September and the 400 amendments introduced by some of my colleagues came as somewhat of a surprise to many of us in the Budget Committee .
while some had a legitimate purpose - to improve financial control of this House over the budget , many more had a destructive intent - not to save money , but to delete very worthy organisations such as the European Union Youth Orchestra .
as it turns out , the moderate face of conservatism has for the most part prevailed over the more ideological and unacceptable one .
there are some 30 amendments now retabled over and above those of our core strategy .
I personally did not put my signature to them because one or two of them still go a little too far .
yet a healthy majority of the Conservative delegation wishes to play a constructive role in the European process - unlike one or two Members who can only think of deconstructing what is here .
this brings me to our group &apos; s strategy , because at the core of our belief is the wish to get value for money for the European citizen .
we want to be sure that funds set aside for specific purposes in the budget will be spent and not accumulated year after year .
this is why we have called for a strategy from the Commissioner to deal with the backlog of commitments , in particular in external policies , by the end of 2003 .
it is my hope that the Council will also be able to agree this strategy .
it includes a limitation on the duration of commitments for which agreement will be required by the Council .
Mr President of the Council , my group could put more payments on the line if we were certain that policies were being better managed .
secondly , we have established reserves in several parts of the budget where we think management of the available funds is weak , in particular setting aside large sums in external policy and for the final amount to be agreed between the two arms of the budgetary authority based on the idea of the performance reserve .
we think this is a good idea , because if you see things are running well than that is where you put your credits .
you do not put it on those programmes which are not running so effectively .
thirdly , and linked to these items , is the request for more posts .
we understand that there is a need for more personnel , but what is of most concern to us is that we do not grant this request until the reform process of the institutions is well under way .
it is difficult to see how more posts will solve the problem of management if there are still antiquated and complex procedures both in the Commission and Council for dealing with the many programmes .
Mrs Schreyer came forward with an interesting suggestion which we should consider about the idea of a performance reserve in category 5 , so that some posts would be available and we could then give more as the process improves .
this is why we have called for a trialogue as soon as possible once this reading is complete , so that we can get down to the substance of the discussions .
greater efficiency within the Commission and more effective policy management over the life of the current financial perspective will give more confidence to the European citizens that their taxes are being put to good use and is the only way to ensure that the EU can achieve the wider goals of consolidation within its boundaries after the nice summit and the gradual enlargement of the EU to the east .
we are looking to rebuild people &apos; s confidence in our institutions .
Europe &apos; s interests will not be served by having a weak Commission and an itinerant Parliament .
on the contrary , we must work for a Parliament which campaigns for openness , efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions .
thank you very much , Mr Elles .
you actually had five minutes .
although you may not realise , you generously gave two minutes to Mr Bourlanges .
in any case , the Presidency wanted to praise not only your eloquence , but also your good faith , because we are sure you thought you had seven minutes .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , first of all I would like to extend warm thanks to the four rapporteurs who have done the groundwork for today .
they have really excelled themselves and I feel this merits the recognition of the House .
we are delighted to have found a basis for negotiations and a mood for negotiation , particularly as regards the Council , given that last year , we had a rather strained atmosphere to contend with , and this produced tension . the present mood allows for objective and focussed work , because instead of drawing up battlelines , we endeavour to actually solve the problems facing us .
however , of course this also means coming clean with the tax payer and those who listen to us , on a whole range of points , so as to give them a realistic picture of the conditions we work under .
Parliament has demonstrated repeatedly over the past few years that extreme financial prudence is the bedrock of our work .
it is pure fiction to maintain that all we have ever been interested in is spending as much money as possible .
that is not our approach !
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you only have to consider the fact that over the past five years , we have kept within the ceilings by EUR 15 billion , to realise that Parliament is at pains to deploy its funds as efficiently as possible .
what we are not prepared to do though , is to simply dismiss out of hand , things we believe to be necessary , and which have been recognised as necessities following negotiations with yourself and the Commission , when there are new items on the agenda .
we cannot have a situation where people who place their trust in us are let down in favour of the next ones in the queue .
and so we must think about how to solve this problem .
in the past - and we attach a great deal of importance to this - we have always kept to our mutual decisions under the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective .
if the rates of increase seem to be high this year , then this is due primarily to the fact that the sharpest rates of increase are to be found in the sphere where we have the least say , i.e. agriculture .
it is not that I want to complain about this .
there has been a corresponding change in policy , and this must be financed accordingly - that is not what I am complaining about - but nor do I expect the President-in-Office to then stand up in this Chamber and say that there has been a huge increase , and comment that the Member States are financially prudent , whilst Parliament wants to push expenditure to the limit .
that is not true , because you are the one primarily responsible for determining compulsory expenditure , and that is precisely where the figures are so high !
when you look at the figures - a 6.3 % increase in compulsory expenditure and , by your own admission , a 0.23 % increase in our areas - then you will see who is really being financially prudent , so as to be able to pursue their policies , and who is responsible for the increases .
with all due respect for the fact that the national Finance Ministers have set out to reduce their national debts and actually cancel commitments entered into in the past , so as to safeguard opportunities for future generations , I would point out that Parliament has commitments from the past too !
we are not in a position to accumulate debt .
perhaps that is just as well .
but we have made promises in the past , or rather made announcements and formulated common policies that will in fact need to be converted into payments at some stage .
we cannot have a situation where we talk in a very relaxed manner about commitments over the years , and repeatedly make these promises , but then , when it comes to paying up , say that we are now unable to afford it and will have to cut back a bit in this area !
I believe it is very important for the Council members to register the fact that payments are commitments entered into in the past that will actually have to be honoured .
we can approach this in two ways with these payments .
Mr Elles made the point that we could of course reduce the commitments and retain the payments , which would enable us to honour the commitments at some stage .
but that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them .
I make no bones about the fact that the policies we agreed on formed the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective .
they are important to us .
these things mattered in the past , but they still matter today - now that we have a different political climate within Europe - particularly as there is so much at stake .
we want to tackle unemployment for example .
one outstanding achievement to come out of this budget is that we are prepared to join forces to support small and medium-sized enterprises , which create the most jobs , thereby benefiting Europe &apos; s economy .
we want to do something for them , and provision has been made for this in the budget in terms of actual figures .
we want to do something to combat social exclusion , and to help the weakest of the weak .
one of the policies we have opted for in the agricultural sector is to move away from a system of direct subsidies towards enhanced support for rural areas .
this is a key priority in Parliament &apos; s book , particularly as we have a right to a say in such matters .
we intend to make sure that this area , more than any other , is given a boost .
we have made it our business , over the past year , to see that all the funds allocated for this sphere were indeed taken up , because it is vital to frame the necessary policies for rural areas and for the people who live there .
we are more than happy to work with the Council and all the others , on this .
I say this as a Social Democrat .
it is traditionally said of the Social Democrats that as a party , they are not the natural representatives of farmers or rural areas .
I will tell you now that we most certainly are , because we believe in equal opportunities .
we have other priorities on the foreign policy front .
we want to combat poverty , wherever it happens to be in the world .
we want to drive democratisation processes forward , and we want to strike a balance between the traditional political fields of foreign policy now before us .
we believe that a constructive approach to eastward enlargement should go hand in hand with a well thought out and properly financed Mediterranean policy .
these two policy areas must be in harmony with each other .
anyone who pursues eastward enlargement , must also be aware that as far as we are concerned , the Mediterranean is also an important part of the geopolitical situation we have to engage ourselves in .
something else we have had to deal with latterly , and which has caused us a great deal of problems - thankfully I would say , because they stem from the fact that a democratisation process is underway - is the situation in the Balkans .
when you , Mr President-in-Office , then say this must be financed from existing budgetary funds , I would ask you to consider just one thing : this year alone we have made 200 000 flexibility instruments available , and supplemented this with EUR 180 million from the emergency reserve .
therefore , this year alone we will have included EUR 380 million in fresh funds in the budgetary lines and made it available .
this problem will occupy us for the next six or seven years , and probably even longer .
when we see that we have already committed EUR 380 million in fresh funds to this area this year , then I am completely baffled as to how , if we estimate that we are going to need EUR 5.5 billion for Serbia over the next seven years , for example , we are going to be able simply to produce it out of thin air .
this would be impossible !
we are prepared to take a look at our budget and see where we could improve our effectiveness .
this would go hand in hand with the reform of the Commission , which , as it happens , has already set us thinking about how we can make our policies more effective overall .
one strategy is to create reserves , and then we must enquire closely , before we make the money available , as to how matters are to be taken forward .
a second strategy is the one used by the Commission , i.e. the reform process within the Commission is being reinforced by making the appropriate number of staff available , so that the steady stream of additional tasks we have taken upon ourselves in the past , can actually be implemented .
the worst thing that can befall us is to arouse hopes and then have to disappoint them .
with your permission , I will again make the point , in the light of a current discussion , that over the past few years , and again this year , Parliament has discussed whether , people who are affected by natural disasters can receive aid from Parliament &apos; s budget .
let there be no mistake , I think it is criminal to give people who have been affected by natural disasters the impression that we have the means to solve all the problems they face as a result .
if we only include a few million in the lines - that is about all we can manage - it is just a stalling tactic , because when the people actually come to need it , we withdraw it again .
when there have been one or two disasters at the beginning of the year , all we need to tell people at the end of the year is that we are sorry but we do not have anything left for them .
there are people in northern Italy who need our help at the moment , but if they were to turn to Europe , we would have to tell them we were sorry but we do not have any money left because we spent it back in January , February or March .
that is completely irresponsible .
that is not the kind of perception we want people to have of Europe .
when we announce something , or promise something , when we say we are able , and want , to help , then we must be in a position to follow this up .
we must organise our political structures accordingly .
we must go through what we define as being the central aspects of our policies with a fine toothcomb , and we must work together to see that our proposals are properly financed .
as Socialists , we expressly offer our cooperation .
I am looking forward to the forthcoming discussions with the Commission and the Council , and hope , in the interests of the citizens of Europe , that we reach some positive conclusions .
Mr President , Mrs Jutta Haug and Mr Markus Ferber have been involved in an enormous task in drafting next years &apos; EU budget .
I wish to congratulate them and , at the same time , thank them for their constructive cooperation .
similarly , I would like to thank Mrs R√ºhle and Mr Colom i Naval and , in particular , the Chairman of the Committee , Terence Wynn .
the budget for 2001 is the second budget during this present programming period .
it continues the budget policy that was outlined in the Interinstitutional Agreement of over a year ago .
my own group is satisfied that strict budgetary discipline was adhered to in the drafting of the budget .
it is right that the committee should have made a special point of focus the reduction in expenditure commitments that are in arrears .
Structural Funds are one year in arrears and the Media programme , for example , is actually eight years in arrears .
administration in the EU has been inexcusably poor , since , for example , last spring around EUR 3 billion of unused funds were returned to Member States .
Mr President , the focus of the budget has been on education and culture , employment and the promotion of SMEs .
we are satisfied with this arrangement .
at present massive unemployment is the scourge of the EU .
for that reason , it is appropriate to increase significantly the financing of unemployment initiatives .
support for SMEs also aims at reducing unemployment , as it is they that create new jobs most effectively .
the most difficult problems in the new budget concern external action .
the basic reason is Agenda 2000 , in which there are too few funds for the construction of the Balkan region .
over the centuries the Balkan region has been Europe &apos; s powder keg and that is the case today too .
however , just EUR 1 850 million were set aside for the development of this region at Berlin , while EUR 4 500 million were spent during the previous period .
the Council reduced funds for the Balkans by EUR 200 million , although there is a massive amount of reconstruction work to be done in the wake of the NATO bombing .
if the EU and the Member States intend to keep their promises regarding the reconstruction of the Balkans , that must be clearly visible in providing finance and not just in proclamations .
the Balkans war , months of bombing and the tremendous devastation that followed will lead to bitterness and hatred that may even last for generations among the inhabitants of the region unless the EU also takes responsibility for the reconstruction work .
the Committee on Budgets has taken a constructive stand on financing .
it wishes to commence talks with the Council in which all the opportunities of the Interinstitutional Agreement would be exploited to solve problems .
the committee is also aiming at a multiannual financial framework for both the cards and the MEDA programmes .
this would serve to lessen the yearly conflict that has tainted the preparation of the EU budget in the last couple of years .
Mr President , it is with these remarks that I would like , on behalf of my group , to support the policy of the Committee on Budgets in next year &apos; s budget .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to echo the congratulations extended to the rapporteurs .
our group will support your proposals for the most part .
however , we oppose the GUE &apos; s strategy , which submitted a proposal out of the blue in the Committee on Budgets yesterday , to reject the budget .
in view of the pressing problems we face in Serbia and Kosovo , we do not believe this strategy to have any serious political intention .
even though we endorse many of the points of criticism directed at the Council , it is clear that a strategy of this kind would lead to a politically untenable confrontation and undermine the credibility of the European institutions .
like the budget before it , Budget 2001 had almost insoluble conflicts to contend with : on the one hand the pressure of consolidation and cost-cutting policy , as agreed under the Interinstitutional Agreement , in order to secure the financing of the enlargement process , and on the other hand , the acute financing needs of the Stability Pact for the Balkans .
this conflict is heightened further , in our view , by the Council &apos; s policy of casually promising everyone aid , and constantly intensifying internal conflicts by making promises of money without thinking seriously about the financing implications .
I must say that is how many people on the outside view the Council &apos; s policy .
instead , Parliament is expected to honour these promises by repeatedly finding new ways to make cuts .
in this way , Parliament &apos; s political room for manoeuvre in the budget is being systematically undermined .
we will end up being nothing more than the Council &apos; s assistants in the implementation process .
this situation cannot be allowed to continue in our view .
however , there is no easy solution .
it is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the Community severely to the test .
financing is a balancing act between needs - financial requirements in the new Member States and financing opportunities for the donor countries - and there are limited public funds .
naturally there is a need to budget carefully , we support this and should not try to get round it .
we are also aware that many projects and programmes are discredited owing to mismanagement .
we urgently need a long- and medium-term strategy , so that important areas such as MEDA and the Stability Pact for the Balkans are not played off against each other .
we fear that Parliament &apos; s present proposal , which we largely endorse , will expose us to this risk .
we fear that the flexibility reserve is probably not being used to finance MEDA , as it should be , but instead , is being employed , at the end of the day , to offset further financial need in Serbia .
we hope to be able to develop a common strategy over the next few weeks in order to counteract this .
we also urgently need a common strategy for improving management .
this will entail a corresponding increase in staffing levels , and here too we are critical of the committee &apos; s majority decisions .
we fear that the majority of the committee members have used the wrong tactics .
demands for improved performance also imply a need for more staff .
as far as we are concerned , linking the demand for improved performance with the demand to place staff in the reserve at the same time will not wash with the public .
we are also critical of the decisions taken with regard to the life programme .
we are hoping that the majority of MEPs will have second thoughts about this on Thursday and vote accordingly , and that we will succeed in reclaiming life from the reserve .
and so finally , to recap : all in all we would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Ferber and Mrs Haug , for their valuable work . there are two or three points that we differ on , but we hope to reach agreement on them yet .
above all , we call upon the parliamentary majority to again think carefully about whether all the staff - i.e. all 400 posts - should really be placed in the reserve , or whether it would not in fact make sense to come to a different vote on this matter .
Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , as you know , my Group has unanimously decided to table a motion rejecting the draft budget for the year 2001 .
this is a truly extraordinary initiative , especially at first reading , and one that is bound to be unsuccessful , for in the present circumstances it cannot possible gain a majority of votes in favour .
we knew as much when we took the decision , so why did we take it ?
every man and every woman here needs to realise that unless we challenge the ultra-restrictive strategy that characterises the Council &apos; s draft budget then , come 2001 , we are going to find ourselves in a situation where we are not able to honour all our commitments to our partners in the Balkans , the southern Mediterranean and other developing regions of the world .
we are going to be in some way forced to choose between these three priorities , even though they are identically legitimate and equally urgent , and this is not , in our view , acceptable .
the Council &apos; s decision to cut a quarter of the appropriations earmarked for the Balkans , even before the change in the situation in Serbia , to cut EUR 150 million of the appropriations intended for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and more generally to cut all appropriations for cooperation with the South is taking us directly down this blind alley .
how is it possible to formally receive President Kostunica at the European Council in Biarritz , to convene an extraordinary Council in Marseilles devoted to Euro-Mediterranean partnership and to make an urbi et orbi proclamation of the most noble aspirations , raising encouraging hopes among the people of Eastern Europe and the south of Europe , without , at the same time , providing ourselves with the means to fulfil these commitments ?
the budget is not the be all and end all , of course , but it does reflect the political will of the fifteen Member States .
for all that , the same approach has been applied to the European Union &apos; s internal policies .
Jacques Chirac spoke lyrically , in this very Chamber , of the Europe of all citizens , male and female , yet the draft budget of the Fifteen envisages an absolute reduction in appropriations in chapters as important as social action , employment , education , training , youth , culture , audiovisual media and the environment .
on some of these lines , even the amendments from the Committee on Budgets , although positive , fall short of the 2000 budget .
this is true for employment , the environment and trans-European networks , and , as we have seen , the problem is even more critical as regards external actions .
we must not allow ourselves to fall into this trap .
the only way to get out of it is to demand that the financial perspective be reviewed , particularly Chapter 4 .
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy has done so , and the President of the European Parliament clearly expressed the same views in Biarritz .
Mrs Haug , the general rapporteur also attempted , last night , to amend her report in this respect in order to reflect the concerns expressed by my Group , and I must thank her for that .
had this amendment been adopted in its initial version , it might have started to deal the cards afresh , but the idea was rejected by the majority of the Committee on Budgets .
so is the European Parliament therefore about to implicitly accept the Council &apos; s position , no matter what it says ?
this is a blind alley , which my Group is not ready to go down .
in this connection , I should like to refer to a crucial passage in the speech by the general rapporteur .
earlier , Mrs Haug quite rightly pointed out that the Council has refused to discuss a multiannual revision of the financial perspective and to continue like this , as she said , &quot; is completely unacceptable . &quot;
so , what conclusions must we logically draw from this situation ?
our motion to reject the Council text is specifically aimed at contributing towards highlighting , in good time , this key political problem on which , sooner or later , we shall have to deliver an opinion in order , in the long term , to match European projects with the resources needed to implement them .
Mr President , Commissioner , the French Presidency of the European Union is coming to an end at the time when Parliament is voting on the budget for 2001 .
there is one fact which must be noted , and which we must , as French Members of Parliament , deplore , and that is that the Council has failed with regard to one of the traditional responsibilities of French politics , its responsibility to the farmers of Europe , with a cut of more than half a billion euros in heading 1 .
it is also , unfortunately , true , as a number of people in this Chamber have commented , with regard to the Mediterranean countries , with a swinging cut in funds for the MEDA programme .
