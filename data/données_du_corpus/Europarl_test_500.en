this has got to be the worst possible message to be sending out to our friends and neighbours around the Mediterranean at the time of enlargement .
in the field of external aid , will we ever be able to realise the hopes of President Kostunica who in recent days has been most forthright in declaring that the fact that France held the Presidency of the European Union at these moments that are so critical for the people of Serbia and the continent as a whole was the work of Providence ?
the amount of aid allocated to the Balkans might give him to think so , with both the EUR 200 million released from the 2000 budget as emergency aid and the appropriations for 2001 which , even so , represent an increase of 30 % over and above the 2000 budget .
that being the case , the level of funding allocated to Kosovo is not without certain problems .
the European Union no longer has any alibi since the fall of Milosevic .
the policy of aid for the Balkans must now concentrate massively on Serbia , a region impoverished by our bombing raids last year and by our economic sanctions which hit it so hard .
the aid we propose to contribute must safeguard rather than threaten the Serbian national identity .
we should , therefore , remember that both Kosovo and Montenegro form an integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
let us therefore put an end to direct aid to these provinces - occasionally without a legal basis , as we saw in this Chamber not so long ago in the case of Montenegro - direct aid that serves primarily to fuel the separatist movements .
in conclusion , we must clearly remember that , as far as we are concerned , aid for the Balkans in no way justifies requests for revision of the financial perspective .
the bottom line of every budget year shows a surplus , indicating that the amounts of appropriations we have voted on do not correspond to the real needs of the situation .
it is possible to make substantial savings , either by saving the monies arising from the under implementation of certain programmes , or by the European Union &apos; s at last taking a decision to stop using budget lines for the purposes of pro-Europe propaganda .
Mr President , as usual , I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino list , and I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the two rapporteurs on the work they have done in recent months and , in general , congratulating the Committee on Budgets on its work .
Mr President , when one hears Mr Wurtz &apos; s ornate , well-argued and well-considered reasoning , it is difficult not to agree with at least the underlying argument , if not the method he recommends .
we do not agree with the method , which is why , in this first reading , we place our confidence in the rapporteur &apos; s approach , in spite of what happened last night in the Committee on Budgets , in the hope that this will constitute a basis for effective discussion with the Council in-between the first and second readings .
however , the issue raised by Mr Wurtz is clearly central .
in my opinion , if we do not revise the financial perspective , we will be being irresponsible towards both ourselves and our partners , especially in the 2001-2006 period .
Mr President , the EU &apos; s budget is the Union &apos; s choice instrument to define political areas of interest as well as core areas .
in this process , we as Parliament need to ensure that we serve the interests of all European citizens .
these may be citizens who would like to see the Union develop into a federation , but also citizens who are sceptical about Europe , as demonstrated recently by the Danish population .
unfortunately , Mrs Haug has adopted a political line which only takes account of the supporters of a federal Europe .
a line in which she , like her predecessor Mr Bourlanges , is attempting to break through the financial ceiling .
over the past few months , Commissioner Patten has repeatedly pointed to the Union &apos; s enormous payment backlog .
unfortunately , the rapporteur still has not grasped that this is why we must tread water for the time being .
&quot; let &apos; s do better with less &quot; , as Commissioner Patten said , is lost on her .
budget policy needs to instil public confidence in European policy .
the fact that this confidence is lacking is obvious from the drop in the currency value of the Euro , which , since its launch , has lost nearly 30 % of its value compared to the yen and the American dollar .
that confidence will not grow by ploughing even more money into the budget , but it will if the budget is implemented efficiently .
for this to happen , difficult choices have to be made , but unfortunately , it appears that the rapporteur is not prepared to make these choices ; instead , she has opted for the easy way out by increasing the budget .
the refusal to set priorities is most prominent in the area of foreign and security policy .
naturally we too are in favour of giving aid to the Balkans and Serbia .
but the money for that aid can be freed up by setting priorities within foreign policy .
what are the core tasks for the Union and what tasks belong to the Member States ?
a Union which does not dare make choices will create more distance between itself and its citizens , who do need to make choices in their personal budgets .
setting priorities is being dodged by abusing the flexibility instrument .
it is quite justified to deploy this instrument for new , unforeseen expenditure and is therefore the principle par excellence in the case of the sudden revolution in Serbia .
the rapporteur &apos; s proposal to use this principle for MEDA , however , does not meet the &apos; new &apos; or &apos; unforeseen &apos; requirement , and is all the more surprising in the light of the fact that spending levels have not been reached in the MEDA programme .
although the rapporteur attended the meeting of the Committee on Budgets yesterday , she failed to draw lessons from the credit transfers which were being discussed .
it appeared yesterday that 25 % of the amount budgeted for 2000 for Latin America was not used and is now being transferred for aid to Kosovo .
Mr Bourlanges made the cursory note that the 2000 budget for Latin America had probably been somewhat too generous .
there is therefore leeway in foreign policy , i.e. category 4 , and the proposed increases of the appropriations budgeted for for Latin America are not based on fact .
the Council agrees with the creation of 400 posts which , according to Commissioner Patten , the Commission needs in order to eliminate the backlog of payments .
in the light of this , it is not justified that the Council should considerably reduce the category 4 payments .
we must give the Commission the opportunity to eliminate the backlog by increasing its staffing levels .
finally , Mr Heaton-Harris was right to refer in his amendments to the onesidedness of many European programmes , in which the citizen is treated to a propaganda-like tale on European integration , and at the expense of the citizens themselves would you believe .
the Union must realise that certainly not all citizens dream of far-reaching integration .
programmes of the Union should therefore adopt a more neutral tone , so as to prevent one specific political hue being put across at the expense of all citizens .
democracy cannot be reconciled with a dictatorship of the majority .
Mr President , one of the principles governing the budgetary process for 2001 is that of saving money .
it is just as well , given that of the 15 Member States only 7 are likely to be able to present a positive balance sheet for the year 2000 .
there is therefore little prospect of us receiving additional revenue in the form of higher contribution payments from the Member States .
we have certainly got our priorities right in Budget 2001 .
to that extent , the rapporteurs are to be congratulated .
it is a fact that the unemployment rate is too high in Europe , particularly as this affects the weak members of society , i.e. young people , women and the long-term unemployed .
we must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises .
we need more entrepreneurs in Europe , who , in their turn , will create more jobs .
there should be no question of Europe failing to keep the promises it makes .
the truth though , is that many European politicians promise funds that they , or their committees , then fail to make available at the end of the day .
I am referring to the absolutely crucial payments required by the Balkan countries , which the Council has now cut back on .
however , it is also unacceptable that many of Europe &apos; s priorities are financed in such a way that the poor are ultimately the ones to suffer .
it was therefore both right and important that the Council &apos; s extensive cuts in agriculture , totalling EUR 55 million , were corrected again .
but at the end of the day , Europe &apos; s priorities will only be financially viable in the long-term if Europe &apos; s economy goes full steam ahead .
the tax burden must therefore be reduced in percentage terms , and only an economic upturn and accompanying economic growth will secure increased state revenue .
in addition , our administrative systems must be modernised , and it is our duty to lead by example .
I therefore hope that the newly created budgetary line - which a few people , myself included , have been critical of - for financing the European parties , is not used to award funds to those who have already squandered away funds made available at national level and are now in fact in debt .
I also hope that the conditions attached to the establishment of 400 additional service posts within the Commission will actually be fulfilled .
I hope that in the course of further negotiations with the Council these principles will actually be upheld , and that in this way , we will be able to jointly adopt a budget for 2001 that benefits the citizens .
Mr President , it is only right that I should begin by commending the work of the various rapporteurs .
as I was able to observe most closely the way in which Mrs Haug dealt with the issues within her remit , I wish to bear witness to the sensitivity and balance that she demonstrated throughout the process .
rather than carrying out a technical analysis of the budget or an interpretation of the amounts provided for in the respective &apos; revenue &apos; and &apos; expenditure &apos; columns , Parliament should concern itself with the quality of both expenditure that has been released and expenditure that has been proposed , which specifically requires an assessment of the criteria for the use of appropriations and also an assessment of their impact .
on the basis of this understanding , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party - European Democrats wishes to highlight the following aspects :
the level of budgetary implementation ;
the degree to which policies that have been laid down are implemented and the results achieved ;
consistency between the legislative process and the budgetary options ;
progress in reforming the Commission .
in the context of these objectives , a raft of measures is proposed for next year , which in our opinion will help to improve the current situation .
firstly , with regard to the low levels of budgetary implementation , in particular of expenditure classified as &quot; non-compulsory &quot; , a special requirement is introduced for requests to the Commission for explanations .
it has to be acknowledged that as long as the explanations requested are not forthcoming or are unsatisfactory , the appropriations in question cannot be used .
furthermore , unless the budget appropriations are used effectively , how can we talk about improvements , which are so necessary in certain categories ?
the second point is that there must be greater speed , transparency and efficiency in administration given the systematic increase in the RAL , that is in amounts still to be paid . this results from the increasing disparity between commitments that have been entered into , payments that have been authorised and payments made , particularly under category 4 - &quot; External actions &quot; .
the needs are self-evident , we have many commitments , the importance of external cooperation in asserting the European Union &apos; s presence on the world stage is obvious , and there is a very low implementation rate for various programmes .
the MEDA programme , which focuses on the Mediterranean basin , a geographical area of the utmost strategic importance , is a good example of our inability to implement our programmes .
we need to make up ground in MEDA and guarantee greater efficiency in Serbia , for example , whilst at the same time effectively implementing the European Union &apos; s traditional policies in this field .
with a view to resolving current bottlenecks , a general reserve should be created under category 4 - a performance reserve - which will be used in proportion to the extent to which the various items are implemented .
furthermore , we hope to see a revision of the Financial Regulation which will set a definite deadline of two years , for example , as the maximum period between the authorisation for payment and payment itself . failure to comply will result in the sums involved being withdrawn from the budget , as already happens in other categories .
the third aspect to be emphasised is that if we wish to see greater coordination between the European institutions , we should promote , in theory and in practice , the integration of the Commission &apos; s legislative programme and the budgetary process , as well as informing Parliament in advance of decisions by other institutions that may have an impact on the budget .
fourthly , with regard to the reform of the Commission &apos; s procedures and staffing policy , we must distinguish between issues relating to new admissions and the desirable - as far as we are concerned - creation of a permanent and compulsory early retirement system .
fifthly , if we value initiative and responsibility , we must promote the creation of a programme aimed at businesses and at business people .
by preserving this strategic approach in the way we address the budget this year and in years to come , the European Parliament will fully play its role in the budgetary process .
parliaments only truly represent their electors , a crucial aspect of democracy , when they refuse to simply rubber stamp other people &apos; s proposals .
thank you very much , Mr Wynn .
we would particularly like to thank you for making us smile and even laugh about a subject as serious as the budget .
that is something for which we should always be thankful .
the debate is closed .
it will resume at 9 p.m .
question Time ( Council )
question No 1 by ( H-0709 / 00 ) :
subject : enhanced cooperation What progress is the Council Presidency making on enhanced cooperation , and could it give examples of areas in which it would apply ?
I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz .
what is more , in his capacity as rapporteur , he asked a question just after the group chairmen .
he has also heard and read Mr Gil-Robles &apos; s report on reinforced cooperation , and my own response to this .
I therefore think he has understood Biarritz &apos; s findings on the matter , which are rather encouraging , and the Council &apos; s quite positive response to Parliament &apos; s and his own suggestions .
thank you for the answer .
I certainly absorbed the messages of Biarritz and I was encouraged by the things that occurred there .
I would just ask Minister Moscovici two further questions .
firstly , would he agree that it would be more sensible to restrict the use of closer cooperation solely to those issues where unanimity applies within the Council ?
as he appreciates , this is a growing feeling within Parliament .
and the second question concerns the reaction of the candidate countries to the debate inside the EU Union concerning closer cooperation .
do you find that they welcome the prospect or are they perhaps frightened of it ?
. ( FR ) our objective is indeed to safeguard what lies at the heart of Community policy , i.e. the internal market and the cohesion policies , reinforced cooperation .
matters are , therefore , perfectly clear . we wish to adhere to the acquis communautaire , but at the same time we should not have regulations that are too inflexible .
it is true that qualified majority voting is the main thing , but we must have some flexibility .
we shall have to take note of the reactions of the candidate countries .
firstly , I think it important that procedures should work properly with 15 Members , which is already a complicated matter .
the French Presidency is probably rather keener than others to get these countries involved .
having said that , to make matters clear , reinforced cooperation does not mean a two-speed Europe .
we have specifically stressed that an open and inclusive approach was needed , and no one should be afraid of reinforced cooperation .
the &apos; small countries &apos; , for example , to use a quite inappropriate term , should not feel themselves excluded from reinforced cooperation or that reinforced cooperation means some sort of exclusive vanguard , centre of gravity or pioneer group .
all it means is that there is a certain flexibility to enable specific policies to go ahead , even if some countries cannot , or do not wish to , participate , and what is true for the European Union &apos; s Member States is also true for the candidate countries .
no one must feel as if they are in a Carriage being towed along by a kind of runaway train .
this is not some sort of directory .
question No 2 by John Cushnahan lapses , as the author is not present .
question No 3 by ( H-0714 / 00 ) :
subject : cost of the activities of the &apos; three Wise Men &apos; in Austria which funds are being used to cover the costs of the activities of the &apos; three Wise Men &apos; , who have been deployed by the Portuguese Presidency to assess the situation in Austria ?
my answer is very simple .
the Council played no part in this matter and the Community budget was not used in any way .
the expenditure committed in order to fund the task of assessing the Austrian situation was actually funded in its entirety at national level by Austria &apos; s 14 partners within the European Union .
the Presidency did , of course , make a contribution to this .
Mr President , Minister Moscovici , one question the public , and also quite a number of MEPs have been asking themselves , is : what was the role of the embassies in this connection ?
given that there is an embassy representing each of the 14 Member States in Vienna , why was it necessary to have the three Wise Men look into something that the embassies could have monitored themselves on a daily basis ?
did the embassies fail in some way ?
did they fail to retrieve the reports ?
did the relevant governments fail to read the reports ?
we really cannot avoid this question .
perhaps it would have sufficed to read one or other newspaper , but I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a brief analysis of the role of the embassies .
this question makes me smile a little .
in my opinion , ambassadors are quite simply there to represent the government of their country .
they must , of course , pass local information back to their government , but the question here was to find a solution to a situation where fourteen Member States had taken measures with regard to the fifteenth for the political reasons that are familiar to you .
I therefore think it was quite appropriate , in this context , to ask an external authority , that was not morally implicated , to undertake this task .
I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done , quite the contrary .
I would add that if any individual country had followed up on their Ambassador &apos; s report , then perhaps the solutions advocated by the experts &apos; report would not have been applied .
as they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together .
question No 4 by ( H-0715 / 00 ) :
subject : Colombia is the Council aware of the most recent massacre , which resulted in eight deaths ; on 8 July 2000 in Colombia in a place called la Union , and has it investigated the possibility that the atrocity was committed with the full support of the Colombian Government ?
has the Council held discussions on this event ?
if so , does it propose to make any formal protest ?
question No 5 by ( H-0776 / 00 ) :
subject : violation of human rights and dismantling of paramilitary groups in Colombia Paramilitary groups have stepped up the murders of farmers , journalists , trade unionists , political leaders and human rights activists over the past few months .
Ramiro Zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and , recently , the Colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups &apos; &quot; Plan 100 &quot; to kill one hundred human rights activists .
the government has recognised the &quot; accidental &quot; killing of six children in Puerto Rico on 15 August .
furthermore , Colombia has not assembled the units that the European Union asked it to create to fight the paramilitaries .
what measures is the Council taking or prepared to take to make aid to Colombia conditional on the Colombian government showing significant progress in respect for human rights and in firm action towards dismantling the paramilitary groups ?
yes , generally the European Union regularly condemns in the strongest possible terms the serious human rights violations which , unfortunately , are still being committed practically every day in Colombia .
the matter to which Mr McCartin refers , however , has not been specifically referred to the Council , and the Council has not mentioned the matter as such in its discussions .
while supporting the efforts made by the Colombian Government to make progress in the peace process , the European Union has stressed , and continues to stress , that government &apos; s necessary commitment to respect for human rights in Colombia .
the European Union has also appealed for the commitment of all parties to seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict , without which it would be impossible to establish any lasting peace .
it is up to the Colombian authorities to define the practical means by which the Colombian Government might undertake to dismantle the paramilitary groups .
recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means .
on several occasions , the European Union has affirmed its willingness to support , to the extent that it can and with the most appropriate means , all efforts to secure a peace agreement .
following the international meeting on the Colombian peace process , held in Madrid on 6 and 7 July 2000 , attended by Mr Solana , the representative of the 15 Member States and the Commission , the European Union is currently looking into practical opportunities for cooperation with Colombia .
you may rest assured , finally , that respect for human rights , and the promotion of human rights , are , in any case , a key component of the European Union &apos; s cooperation with third countries .
Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply which was very comprehensive .
I am a bit happier with the attitude of the Council today than I was in July because , as on many occasions in situations of crisis , the European Union seems always to be the last authority to arrive on the international scene and make its voice heard .
I also appreciate the expertise of Mr Solana in South American affairs and I recognise that we have made some progress .
nevertheless , is the Council aware of the amount of money that the European Union provides , something like ten times what the United States provides for development cooperation throughout the world ?
yet when a crisis occurs , whether in Africa , South America , the Middle East or the far East , it is the United States and not the European voice that is heard .
does the President-in-Office recognise that we are failing to capitalise on the resources that we provide ?
I am not unaware of amount of money the Americans are promising in aid for Colombia , for example , the bulk of which is earmarked for activities to combat drugs trafficking .
this is something I am aware of , even if this plan is occasionally criticised , for instance , by NGOs .
at the same time , from my own experience , I think you are somewhat mistaken in making such a generalisation .
as far as Africa , the Middle East or the Mediterranean are concerned , the European Union is in fact the largest donor .
but in that case we are in a rather peculiar situation given the historical links between the United Sates and the continent of South America .
we are , nonetheless , paying a great deal of attention to the way this situation is developing .
thank you for the information , Mr President , and thank you for giving me the floor .
many of us believe that the problems in Colombia , as in other Latin American countries , stem from the issue of whether or not peasant-farmers own land .
in 1984 , 0.2 % of landowners in Colombia owned 32 % of the land .
in 1997 , this figure stood at 45 % , and today will be even higher .
this is the problem , in addition , in many cases , to the actions of the paramilitaries , who force the peasant-farmers to move by means of indiscriminate killings .
here we have three cases in different parts of the country : in the village of Carmen , 500 people were forced to move by the murder of 14 peasant-farmers .
in the port of Buenaventura , 20 peasant-farmers were murdered .
far away , in another area called Ciénaga , there have been over 200 murders since the paramilitaries moved in a year ago .
the question , Mr President , and I shall end here , is whether there is a solution that would exert greater pressure than that proposed by the President in his statement and whether the aid we are going to give will be entirely different from that of the United States , in other words , not intended for crop-spraying , but for crop replacement and also for social , rather than military , purposes .
let me briefly say that I am taking note of the explanation you have just given , but I should like to specify that the European Union hopes to set up its own programme of socio-economic and institutional aid for the Colombian peace process , and we shall readily return to it when we have made more progress in this area .
Mr President , I want to address the question of the paramilitaries &apos; involvement in the la Unión massacre .
would the minister agree that by and large it is clearly known that the paramilitaries concerned act as proxies for the Colombian Government ?
is he not concerned , therefore , that Plan Colombia intends to provide military aid to the Colombian Government , use military resources to spray crops , allegedly drugs crops , and that the European Union is expected to come in and mop up the problem with a social policy programme ?
this is an inadequate response by the European Union .
we should not be agreeing to Plan Colombia on that basis .
I should just like to confirm my previous answer .
while taking the honourable Member &apos; s comments very seriously , I still think that this aid is useful and should be intensified .
will he today repeat that the Council will not support Plan Colombia , as Mr De Rossa and I and every civilised Member of this House want ?
I think I have already answered this question .
the Council is not here to make comments on every aspect of this extremely sensitive and painful issue .
with your permission , Mr President , I shall confine myself to the answers I have already given .
it is the duty of the President of the sitting to guide and interpret the questions and it is then at the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council how to discuss or respond to them , except where the questions are nonsensical or have nothing to do with the subject .
then I will exercise my responsibility .
Mr De Rossa has the floor on a point of order .
Mr President , when you mention the text of the supplementaries and the President-in-Office &apos; s response , could I remind the President-in-Office that the original question specifically related to the massacre in Colombia , whether or not the Council has had discussions on this event and if it plans to make any formal protest or not .
the questions that I and other Members asked are very specifically related to the situation in Colombia .
it is not adequate to say that you are not in a position , and it is not your role , to go into this kind of detail .
the question asks you to go into detail .
why accept the question at all if you are not going to go into the detail ?
Mr De Rossa , I have to tell you that the Rules of Procedure do not allow for responses from Members , but merely their questions .
afterwards you may deal bilaterally with the President-in-Office of the Council , either in writing or in person .
let me make myself clear . a question was asked of me , and I answered that question .
I specifically stated - and this will have been noted in the Minutes - that the incident you refer to in your question has not been specifically referred to the Council and that the Council has not mentioned the matter as such in this debate .
I had , therefore , answered your question .
I should not like you to think that the Council does not answer the questions asked of it .
at the same time , it is just not possible to undertake an ad hoc debate on matters like this , which are , let me repeat , extremely complex ones .
I utterly respect what the Members of Parliament are saying .
it is just that I am trying not to indulge in demagoguery .
I would ask you all to comply with Questions to the Council in accordance with the rules for this procedure as they are laid down .
as far as possible , the debate should not be academic and theoretical .
I would therefore ask that when you put further questions , they are specific questions on the matter in hand .
as they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 will be taken together .
question No 6 by ( H-0718 / 00 ) :
subject : international financial transactions at the next annual meeting of the IMF , does the Council plan to propose that the IMF Committee should study possible arrangements for introducing a Tobin-type tax on international financial transactions with a view to combating speculation and stabilising currency markets ?
question No 7 by ( H-0719 / 00 ) :
what should the priorities be for the allocation of such resources ( e.g. access to drinking water , protection of the environment , cancelling the debt of the poorest countries , vaccination programmes , access to education ) ?
question No 8 by ( H-0720 / 00 ) :
subject : Tobin tax how does the Council intend to help future governments deal with the emerging crisis in national taxation because of tax competition and off-shore financial centres , and would it consider new streams of taxable revenue such as currency transactions ?
question No 9 by ( H-0721 / 00 ) :
subject : political and technical obstacles to the introduction of a Tobin-style tax The Council is well aware of the broad support and growing popularity enjoyed by the proposal for a Tobin-style tax .
with reference to any discussions it may have held with the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs of the EU Member States and of third countries , will the Council Presidency say who is opposed to this measure and what the main political and technical obstacles are to the introduction of a tax of this kind ?
question No 10 by ( H-0722 / 00 ) :
subject : consideration of the merits of taxing international financial transactions is the Council Presidency willing to open a discussion within the Council of Finance Ministers ( Ecofin ) on the merits of imposing a tax on international financial transactions within the exchange market in order to combat speculation and the destabilising effects which the latter has on the economies of entire countries ?
would the Council be willing to consider establishing a &apos; Tobin area &apos; at European Union level , i.e. imposing a Tobin tax on Europe &apos; s financial markets , which account for 50 % of world currency-exchange transactions ?
question No 11 by ( H-0725 / 00 ) :
subject : viability of Tobin-type taxes at European level In view of the recent report issued by the French Minister of Finance indicating that Tobin-type taxes would not be viable if introduced by a single Member State , what steps does the French Presidency propose with a view to securing the viability of such taxes at European Union and global level ?
question No 12 by ( H-0735 / 00 ) :
subject : tax on financial transactions In recent months there have been growing calls for a tax on financial speculation , with ATTAC committees ( association for a tax on financial transactions and aid for citizens ) springing up in France and Europe , as well as the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and Senate .
this movement raises fundamental questions , such as the respective roles of man and the world of finance in today &apos; s economy .
does the Council not think that a Tobin-style tax would be desirable in the interests of restoring balance in this area ?
question No 13 by ( H-0815 / 00 ) :
subject : Tobin tax and the international financial architecture In the Presidency &apos; s view , which European institution would be most appropriate , in the context of international economic and financial relations , to promote the introduction of a Tobin tax and , should the circumstances arise , to administer such a tax ?
what impact would the introduction of a Tobin tax have in terms of combating worldwide currency speculation ?
no , I shall try not to give you too academic an answer , but you put me in a difficult position in asking me these questions because we could easily spend more than one evening answering , and in any case we shall no doubt be overrunning the allotted hour with the questions that are coming up .
this matter raises questions of the objectives to be pursued , and questions of philosophy , of convictions and of analysis .
indeed everyone applies their own convictions and their own analysis in expressing their views on this subject .
I should just like to say , once again , speaking on behalf of the Council , that the Council is perfectly aware of topical events and the importance of these issues .
the creation of a Tobin tax is an attractive option , one championed by many Members on both the left and right wing , by a variety of political and non-political organisations , non-governmental organisations , university groups .
I shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question .
I should just like to stress some of the practical problems which may give rise to debate , since this is the Council &apos; s position .
firstly , I think everyone recognises that this tax , known as Tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level .
it must be noted , however , that while it may be possible to seek a consensus within the European Union , no such consensus exists within G7 , especially within the OECD , regarding levying a tax on exchange transactions .
we are even aware , and this is an economic line of reasoning , that if there were a broad consensus , then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory .
the question that I must ask those who advocate the Tobin tax , therefore , is exactly how we can offset that risk that would exist that speculative activities would shift location to tax havens , since this is a phenomenon which must be avoided if such a tax were to be adopted .
I should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets , particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50 % .
there would , besides , be a risk of this tax being bypassed due to the high level of innovative performance in the modern financial world .
the real question I have , then , does not concern the objectives of the Tobin tax , i.e. regulation of the exchange markets , making these markets more ethical by using them to fund development , but rather on our ability to ensure that these mechanisms are effective .
once again , this does not indicate my opposition in principle to the idea , as I am not opposed to it , certainly on a personal basis .
at the recent meetings in Prague , and at the meetings of the G7 and the International Monetary and Financial Committee ( IMFC ) , in its capacity as Presidency of the European Union , France proposed focuses for reform intended to provide a response to the concerns behind the , now old , proposal of establishing a Tobin-type tax .
the communiqués of the G7 , the IMFC and the statements of the IMF Director-General , Mr Köhler , moreover reflect the sympathies that exist in relation to the policy guidelines promoted by France , particularly as regards ordered financial liberalisation and combating money laundering .
this fight , which is one of the priorities of the French Presidency , was expressed at both the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council , and recently in a combined meeting of these two Councils .
I am aware that I am unable to respond fully right now to the question asked .
I suppose you expect the Council to simply say yes .
I think the question is a little bit too complex to give a simple yes or no answer , because while we may approve of the principles , there is still the outstanding matter of the practical arrangements , not to mention the existence of a consensus between the 15 Member States .
Mr President , I do not refute your own personal convictions .
it is just that we get the impression , and your answer testifies to this somewhat , that the Council Presidency is not being very proactive in dealing with this issue .
you mentioned the uncooperative attitude of the tax havens .
I think this is within the realms of possibility and we should like to see the Presidency of the European Union adopting a clearer stance on this issue .
I must act prudently , not in general but in using terms such as &apos; code of conduct &apos; .
just as much as in the case of the Tobin tax , the debate is ongoing . just as much as in terms of combating money laundering and tax havens , the Presidency is displaying a great deal of resolve and the Ecofin Council in particular has adopted a draft directive to combat money laundering .
this is therefore a key policy guideline which , without constituting an alternative to the project for the Tobin tax , is perhaps more realistic in the short term and is one which the current Presidency values extremely highly .
indeed we hope that this will prove to be one of the main practical achievements of this Presidency .
Mr President , just now you mentioned those opposed to the Tobin tax , particularly G7 .
let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax .
in one of its resolutions , the ACP-EU joint Assembly , held in Brussels from 9 to 12 October , referred explicitly in recital C and in paragraph 21 to the creation of a Tobin tax .
in paragraph 26 , moreover , it called for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation to cancel the debts of the countries of the South .
Mr President , could the Council not consider ways to help cancel the debt of the countries of the South , given that the ACP countries are asking for a solution similar to the Tobin tax ?
would it not be possible to reinitiate discussions on this , given that we have committed ourselves , under the Cotonou agreements , to helping them to find ways to arrange the cancellation of their debt ?
I think this is an interesting suggestion too , one that warrants looking into , but at the same time I think you have to understand the ambiguities we are liable to face .
as James Tobin said himself , the greater the product of this tax , the more it will have missed its target , as this will indicate that short-term speculative amounts have not been eliminated .
Mr Tobin is himself opposed to the principle of using this tax to fund development other than as a secondary objective , as a tax intended to restrict and even prohibit certain types of transaction cannot at the same time seek to provide ongoing funding of development schemes .
this is the principle , with which economists are familiar , of focussing an instrument on a single objective .
we do have to consider a number of questions calling for specific answers , particularly on the subject of funding development , and clearly efforts must focus on the improvement and the quality of state aid for development , the development of trade , strengthening international financial institutions , and the issue of debt must be considered in depth once again .
Mr President , President-in-Office , there happens to be a section of the Finnish government &apos; s programme which refers to sources of taxation such as these .
you mentioned the question of tax havens and money laundering in connection with this .
could you compile a new package of reforms from this on behalf of the Council ?
not having had the privilege of chairing the Ecofin Council I cannot answer your questions , particularly on the links which may exist between the French Presidency and the Finnish Government .
I am sorry .
in the first place I take exception to the argument that any tax tends naturally to reduce the consumption of the factor on which it is levied . it is true for all taxes and today there is no tax where the taxable activity has completely ceased .
people have not stopped working just because there is income tax . they have not stopped polluting just because there are taxes on pollution , and they are not about to stop transferring money from one country to another just because there is a Tobin tax .
so , clearly , the revenue from this levy will not be zero .
it will all depend on its level , but there are a number of possible strategies and I agree completely with you that the objective of funding is secondary to the objective of combating speculation .
the thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation .
the minor amount you mention is precisely in the same order as the daily variations in the euro / dollar exchange rate , and this is something we are attempting to combat by other , infinitely more costly methods .
I should just like to repeat what I was saying , which is that the influence of a tax of this kind on the volatility of the exchange market has not actually been proven .
I think that , in spite of everything , fluctuations in the euro / dollar exchange rate are , unfortunately , higher than this sort of value , and it is true that we have to deal , in the long term , with speculators who expect far greater devaluation .
indeed this is what has happened in the case of the euro over the year , whether we like it or not .
Mr Lipietz , for instance , is too fine an economist not to realise that economics is just another form of political science .
so what has happened since then ?
was it the report by the Minister for the economy and for Finance , the administration of the Treasury , which so effectively expressed the usual arguments of those opposed to the Tobin tax which thwarted the political will demonstrated in the stance adopted in your newspaper article ?
who is going to win the day , Bercy - as we refer to the Minister of the economy in France - or the determination you expressed back then ?
surely the time has come to stop passing the buck ?
at national level , we are told to refer to Europe . now , at European level , we are told to refer to the G7 or the OECD .
surely the time has come , specifically , to submit a proposal to the Council and the Commission so that we can issue a coordinated position from the various countries of Europe which will support the position of the other G7 members , such as Canada , for instance , which is ready to implement a Tobin tax as long as we ourselves are moving in this direction ?
please forgive me , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking shop with our internal French business here .
you have before you not Pierre Moscovici the militant or even Pierre Moscovici , speaking in his capacity as Minister , although I have attempted to introduce a few personal remarks in relation to the position prepared for me .
I am supposed to be speaking on behalf of the Council , the Council being the body uniting the ministers of the 15 European Union Member States .
I have indeed , therefore , attempted to include a few comments in my capacity as Minister where these do not contradict what I might have written as a militant politician in a French daily newspaper , but you must understand that I must also play my official part here today .
I am , moreover , delighted that Mr Harlem Désir , who , if you did not already know , is in the same party as myself , would be willing to sign the same declaration as myself .
that is not always the case .
Mr Moscovici , you can see that the eight questions come from the left of the Chamber .
therefore , they sometimes cannot distinguish the President-in-Office of the Council from a militant .
I also excuse them , but we shall apply the Rules of Procedure .
I have three brief questions for Mr Moscovici .
firstly , will he come and speak to us as a militant on a future occasion ?
secondly , is he aware that the recent Labour Party Conference passed a document which overwhelmingly said that they would work with its international partners and all stake-holders towards addressing the concerns raised by advocates of the Tobin tax and introducing new mechanisms for international stability and better global financial regulation ?
there are any number of places where I am willing to express a militant opinion .
in many respects I feel sympathetic to their ideas , but the fact is that in this place , now and every time I address you , I have to represent the Council during Question Time .
so perhaps we should arrange some other type of meeting .
as regards the question you addressed to the Council , i.e. the idea of study , please be assured that I shall convey your idea , most sympathetically , to the chairman of the Ecofin council , who incidentally is also a Government Minister , and perhaps this will also answer Mr Harlem Désir &apos; s concerns .
I shall , of course , continue in the same vein , especially as I feel we must consider that this debate bears witness to the fact that increasing numbers of people , particularly within the European Union , are wondering about applying stricter control to financial speculation and also about the ability of the political authorities to intervene in this economic sphere and the extravagant powers of the multinationals .
once again , I am anxious to curtail the philosophical , ideological and political elements of my answer .
I should just like to repeat , once again , the fact that in discussing the Tobin tax , we must also question the conditions for the effectiveness of such a tax .
I myself pointed out the reservations which Tobin himself expressed , in the final analysis , regarding his own instrument , particularly in terms of revenue .
indeed I think it crucial to organise , at some venue or other , debates where the arguments for both sides can be presented .
I know that there are many people on both sides , both in favour of and against the Tobin tax .
I think we should perhaps attempt to get outside the too narrow area of Preferences in order to also ask economic questions .
the basic question I would like an answer to , and I am speaking as an all-round figure which includes my militant persona , is what are the conditions necessary for it to work .
Mr President-in Office , you said at the start of your speech that this matter could be discussed endlessly here in Parliament .
you are quite right and I would also like to remind you that we have already once discussed this subject in great detail , and these very same colleagues of mine asked the same questions before .
the reason why we have been quiet here on the right is therefore that we have already examined these matters once and , in our opinion , we do not need to talk about the same issues over and over again in this Chamber and use up our precious time doing so .
the adoption of the Tobin tax on a global scale will be impossible .
forgive me , I did not quite understand the last part of the question .
I take note of the fact that , fortunately , moreover , there are proponents of the Tobin tax on all sides of the house . this sets my mind at rest somewhat .
I should not like people to think that it is a peculiar form of madness affecting only one side of the brain or indeed one side of the House .
as for the rest , I should just like to add that France has indeed looked into a number of areas of reform with a view to answering the concerns behind the proposal to establish a Tobin-type tax , even if questions of how it is actually going to work remain unanswered .
I do agree with you , however , we could be discussing this for a long time to come .
question No 15 by ( H-0729 / 00 ) :
subject : spread of BSE It appears that BSE is more contagious than was generally thought and that several other animal species can carry the disease .
in recent months the disease has been detected , inter alia , in various areas of France .
how does the Council intend to prepare for the spread of BSE , and what principle does it think should be adopted for compensating livestock owners in its decisions on budget expenditure ?
the number of cases of BSE , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , that have been identified in Europe over the last few years is , as we know , a major area of concern .
the Council is more than ever anxious to take every step possible in order to eradicate this disease .
I should like to specify briefly that the recent increase in the number of cases identified does not mean that the epidemic is spreading wildly .
it is , rather , the case that things are coming to light as a result of the increasingly widespread performance of tests on cattle carcasses which proves that the epidemic has , nonetheless , not ceased .
on 7 January 1999 , the Commission put forward a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation seeking to consolidate the texts previously adopted by the Commission as precautionary measures in order to establish rules for the prevention and supervision of certain forms of BSE .
this proposal is based on the recommendation of the International Office of Epizootics on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and the various scientific opinions available .
this was designed to offer consumers a guarantee of a very high level of protection .
the European Parliament delivered its opinion on the Commission proposal at first reading , during the sittings of 15 and 19 May 2000 .
it adopted 48 amendments , 40 of which were accepted by the Commission .
the Council is actively involved in examining the Commission proposal and these amendments with a view to managing in the near future to issue a position on this .
moreover , in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in June 2000 , in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer .
the decision therefore applies to the production and commercialisation of products derived from animals that are made from or contain materials from animals of bovine , ovine or caprine species .
there are additional restrictions which apply to the United Kingdom and Portugal .
the Council , of course , is careful to monitor development in scientific findings and in the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests .
these can then be taken into account in the text of directives on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which the Council is to submit to the European Parliament .
the Council has not received any Commission proposal on compensation for farmers .
for the time being , as you know , applications are to be made to national budgets in procedures for the compensation of livestock farmers .
Mr President , I thank the minister for his reply to the first part of my question , but his answer to the second part , which concerned compensation , was not entirely relevant .
new cases have cropped up in France and , as a result , whole herds have been slaughtered .
now I would like to ask , while the French representative of the country holding the presidency is here , whether this slaughter of cows will be paid for out of the EU budget or will you be paying for them out of your national budget , and whether , in your opinion , it is indeed appropriate that they should be paid for out of the EU budget .
and I should like to add another question . according to a press report today mad cow disease has been discovered here in the Vosges region .
can France give the Members of the European Parliament assurances that nobody will catch the disease from the meat they eat here ?
I have not read this morning &apos; s papers yet , but I believe I can make a sincere case to promote French beef in general .
I am just answering back after your sally .
on a more serious note , as regards the idea of the possible compensation of farmers , I can only repeat the information available to me , which is to say that the Council has , for the time being , received no proposals from the Commission on this subject .
to put it quite plainly this means that no Community funding is planned at this stage .
thus , for the time being , any procedures for compensation for farmers must be addressed to the national budgets .
my question follows on from the last point Mr Seppänen made .
there is also statistical evidence that there is an increase of BSE in France and Portugal .
will the Council ask the Commission to ensure that all necessary public health measures are being enforced in all 15 Member States , to ensure this disease is finally eradicated from the European Union ?
I should not like to get into this very acrimonious debate or to get involved in bilateral French-British considerations .
I think this is not the right place and I am not the right person to discuss such matters .
I would just like to assure Mr Martin that the Council , which I am representing here , does indeed wish to ensure that measures are undertaken in all the countries of the European Union .
this is something other than a bilateral dispute . moreover , that dispute - to put on my French hat for a moment - is one that we regret and we would have preferred not to have had to initiate it , even though we thought it necessary for consumer safety .
in the press recently we have been able to read that a number of European Union documents mentioned an &apos; accidental share of 0.3 % of animal meal &apos; , whether this was acceptable or not .
I should like to know , specifically , since this question has arisen , if this accidental 0.3 % share is becoming an authorised 0.3 % share for animal meal . if this were so , it would truly be an underhand way of subverting the precautionary principle which we are attempting to implement here .
Mrs Isler Béguin will pardon me if I do not wish to go into great detail in response to a debate on BSE which has a justifiable place in this House after entering into a debate on the Tobin tax .
I do not have any information other than that I have already given you .
I shall refrain from commenting on press articles concerning Community documents with which I am not familiar at the present time .
as usual , however , I can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us .
Mr President , on a point of order would it be possible to reinstate Question No 2 ?
I was at a foreign affairs meeting when this question came up .
unfortunately I had no prior notice that it was coming up because I have been in Sri Lanka for the last month heading an EU mission to observe the elections .
I beg your indulgence to hear the answer please .
I must tell you , Mr Cushnahan , that the document is distributed to all Members in their pigeonholes and that the secretariat of each political Group receives them on Mondays .
there is a rule : when you are not in the room at the appropriate time , the agenda continues .
the final question , therefore , is by Mrs Isler Béguin .
question No 16 by ( H-0731 / 00 ) :
subject : ban on oil tankers in the Strait of Bonifacio The Strait of Bonifacio is an extremely dangerous passage for shipping .
and yet more than 4 000 vessels sail through it each year .
the Corsican and Sardinian coastlines on either side are of exceptional ecological and historical value , as acknowledged by the 1993 Franco-Italian agreement , which prohibits French and Italian merchant ships carrying hazardous products from travelling through the strait .
far too much use is made of this passage by international shipping , in the hope of gaining no more than four hours , with all the risks it entails for vessels , many of which are in poor condition .
how many potential Erikas sail through it each year ?
when can we expect the next disaster ?
will the Council undertake to extend the existing ban to all vessels , whatever country they come from , and to introduce binding measures to protect the marine environment ?
as it stands , Community legislation on the maritime transportation of dangerous or polluting goods concerns the minimum conditions required for vessels bound for , or leaving , Community ports .
these vessels are therefore bound to provide the Member State authorities with information on their itinerary and their cargo .
furthermore , the directive on inspection by the port state requires Member Sates to inspect foreign vessels entering their ports in order to check that they are compliant with Community and international legislation on maritime safety , protection of the marine environment and working and living conditions .
regarding international traffic in transit , international law stipulates , subject to certain reservations , that the vessels of all states have the &apos; right of innocent passage &apos; in territorial waters .
the coastal states , however , while respecting this &apos; right of innocent passage &apos; , are authorised to set a number of requirements in order to ensure the safety of shipping and protection of the environment .
in this context , the Commission has announced that it would present a proposal for improvement of the supervision of maritime navigation off European coasts .
already , following proposals by France and Italy , the International Maritime Organisation , IMO , has adopted two resolutions , which have been in force since 1 December 1998 , on establishing rules for shipping traffic in the Strait of Bonifacio and making it compulsory for vessels entering the strait to identify themselves .
it should also be pointed out that , following the wreck of the Erika oil tanker , the European Union has taken the initiative of encouraging , within the IMO , studies about replacing single hulled oil tankers with double hulled oil tankers .
the Council also recently issued favourable guidelines on the draft directives amending the 1995 directive on the inspection of vessels by the state port , and the draft on vessel inspection bodies .
these two drafts , which are currently being examined by Parliament under the codecision procedure , are further aspects contributing to reducing the risk of pollution .
thank you for your answer , Mr President , but the question went rather further .
I should moreover like to point out , however , that there are other constraints upon us .
regarding international traffic in transit , international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the law of the Sea , stipulates , subject to certain reservations , that the vessels of all states have the &apos; right of innocent passage &apos; in territorial waters .
however , the coastal state may - in accordance with the terms of the Convention and other rules of international law - adopt legislation and regulations on innocent passage in territorial waters that may have a bearing on the following aspects : shipping safety , regulation of shipping traffic , conservation of the coastal state environment , the prevention , reduction and control of pollution .
this is what we wanted to do in this context .
however , and this is a complete response to your question , any ban on all ships passing through the Strait of Bonifacio would have to be agreed at the international level and be subject to an international convention .
any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law .
Mr President , I have just one additional question .
what constitutes &apos; innocent passage &apos; by a passenger boat through a strait like this ?
excellent question .
thank you for asking .
as the time allotted to Questions to the Council has run out , Question Nos 17 to 46 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes Question Time .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
2001 budget procedure ( continuation )
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the 2001 budget procedure .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur .
along with other speakers , I have the impression that this year &apos; s budget is particularly complex .
some sections of the budget are difficult to implement .
I therefore believe that , in principle , we ought to support the Commission proposals for revising their staffing policy .
finally , I also endorse the observation made in the Haug resolution that we need to pay bills on time as soon as possible , because the Commission will not come out smelling of roses if this situation continues for much longer .
I would also like to say a few things about agriculture .
in my opinion , the Commission has put up a poor show and the Council has compounded the situation by beating the Commission down on its agricultural expenditure schedule right at the start of this year in the Council meeting of July of this year .
we agreed on an ad-hoc procedure a few years ago which stipulated that we would determine agricultural expenditure more or less at the end of October in the lettre rectificative and yes , that is the long and short of it .
it escapes me how the Commission can give this estimate as early as February and the Council in July .
it amounts to no more than a stab in the dark and I believe that , if we agree on a set amount and if there is an added amount in Berlin , we should also try to fulfil that agreement .
the main point of discussion is category 4 .
how can we finance emergency aid for the Balkans ?
I am in favour of it .
I believe we ought to do something in Serbia and the western Balkans as a matter of urgency .
the key question is , of course , how to finance this ?
I am not a fan of artificially increasing certain budget lines so that we subsequently have to say that we need to exceed the financial perspective .
I would prefer us to first of all try to find the funds within the financial perspective .
if necessary , we could always look further afield , but at this stage , I have no reason to assume this .
I would like to say a few words about the budget implementation .
I wanted to make two points , in particular .
I have just received a letter today from the Commissioner on the implementation of the SOS helpline , which , sadly , is desperately needed in Europe .
the Commission does not label this as information policy , but social policy .
seen in this light , it does not belong in a line as voted by Parliament .
I would question that , for I think that it is just as much information policy as it is social policy , and I therefore hope to return to this topic within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development shortly .
the second point I wanted to make concerns quality policy for agricultural products , for which Parliament earmarked 50 million of the budget last year .
this has never been more topical .
the Commission made very little effort to implement this policy , which is deplorable .
Mr President , the European Union &apos; s budget for next year has been prepared in difficult circumstances .
that is the fault of the Council .
the problems are the same as last year .
the previous European Parliament made this Interinstitutional Agreement , which was binding on this Parliament , a couple of months prior to the commencement of this parliamentary term , and it specified too low a ceiling for category 4 expenditure .
then it was not known that the Council and the Commission would be promising aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo , to come out of this money .
the political commitments made to the forces of opposition in the area of the former Yugoslavia must now be redeemed .
in this particular case that means revising the ceiling for category 4 .
if the Council does not agree to that , Parliament will have to terminate the Interinstitutional Agreement on so-called budgetary discipline .
new money is needed in the budget for Serbia and Kosovo .
it is not right that the assistance to the poor in the area of Yugoslavia should be paid for by the poor in the area of the Mediterranean , Russia or other poor countries , although the Council would have it that that is precisely how we should go about matters .
I would like to focus attention on the fact that there seem to be sufficient amounts of European Union money for financing political parties at European level , but not , for example , for the prevention of unemployment .
I am astonished at the proposal that Europarty support should be paid for out of the Commission &apos; s article in category 3 .
that would mean that the Europarties would be getting support twice over .
if they have not hesitated before to misappropriate the European Parliament &apos; s resources to finance their own work , we can only imagine that they are continuing to do so , although they might be receiving subsidies from the Commission .
or does someone believe that the Europarties are being made to pay rent to Parliament or pay for their own communications costs here ?
our group takes a mainly dim view of Europarty support and its abuse in the future .
Mr President , this year &apos; s budget is , in my opinion , neither very negative nor very positive .
why is this ?
going so far as to hold back on the decision on the operations in Kosovo and Serbia at a time of such pressing urgency while advancing mere formal issues is certainly not a good image for the Community to be presenting to the rest of the world in political terms .
I would nevertheless emphasise , in particular , that , six months ago , one of the political priorities was stressed in this Chamber .
well , none of this has been achieved .
quite the contrary . at a time in which , with the approach of enlargement and the euro crisis , we need to reinforce the bridges created over the last 50 years between the peoples of the European Union and the Union itself , a Community intervention to assist the peoples who are victims of natural disasters is , at the very least , politically appropriate , and is morally urgent .
this is just one of the potential situations . another scenario is that the Member States are left to do entirely as they please .
by acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity , the Union is , in actual fact , shirking one of its responsibilities , as it has in recent weeks both in northern Italy and in Spain .
my observations are frequently criticised for lacking a legal basis .
well , I am going to give you a few references .
how many entire families are at death &apos; s door ?
is one of the Union &apos; s objectives not to protect health and safety ?
this is part of title 13 of the Treaty .
how many entire road and other transport networks are becoming unusable ?
is one of the Union &apos; s objectives not to make them usable once more ?
that is what title 5 of the Treaty says .
we could also cite title 7 and title 8 of the Treaty on industries and firms which are forced to close down .
are we not going to jeopardise the common economic and employment policy ?
I refer you to title 2 of the Treaty .
as for harvests which are wiped out in the space of a few days , does this not come under one of the pillars of the Union ?
so let us stop trying to hide behind a pointing finger and do something instead !
where is the problem ?
does this House really feel that a Community intervention in this sector would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity ?
I do not think so , and I feel that it is morally right to support the amendment upon which we are going to vote on Thursday .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our budget for 2001 , with its EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations adds two new items to the traditional features .
as far as new features are concerned , in the first place , it is the first time the budget has been presented in functional terms , classed by programme and not just according to administrative divisions , with 19 policies covering 200 activities , which is the system currently used in most countries . France is currently carrying out reforms to this end .
the second new feature is the shift in the battleground the budget war is waged on .
as regards the traditional features , apart from the problems of ensuring that the projections are honest ones , we have , first of all , the problem of budgetary cuts for European farmers , with EUR 300 million of agricultural aid and EUR 225 million of appropriations for rural development cut .
there is nothing for beekeepers , who were asking for a mere EUR 15 million , even though it is possible to increase expenditure for the Balkans by 30 % .
the second traditional feature is the way ideological allies are fêted .
we have the whole kit and caboodle of subsidies for associations working with drugs , xenophobia , immigrants , the Jean Monnet House , the exile council , the European monitoring centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , even the PRINCE campaign . EUR 38 million are being cast away on the campaign on the euro .
finally , the third traditional feature is the budgetary funds poured into foreign Preferences .
there are poor people in Europe too , even if only retired farm workers .
it is shocking to see Mr Wurtz and Mr Fodé proposing amendments to give appropriations to Chile , Australia , South Africa .
Charity begins everywhere except at home . we are even throwing EUR 250 000 away for the WTO &apos; world parliament &apos; .
I hope , Mr President , and this is my concluding remark , that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement .
I hope that not one single euro will go to the Israeli army so that they can buy bullets to kill Palestinian youths on their own soil .
Mr President , in the Haug report the sentiment is expressed that the Commission , in close cooperation with Parliament , is responsible for providing information to the European citizen about the policies of the European Union .
but Parliament has another responsibility : it is to represent the concerns of the citizens of Member States to the European Union , something which appears to be discouraged here .
it will be not unknown to some Members here that my party , the UKIP , seeks the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union .
what Members will not be aware of , though , is that according to recent opinion polls , that is now the majority view of United Kingdom subjects .
as an MEP who cares about that majority , how can I endorse the spending of GBP 11.5 billion of UK taxpayers &apos; money - that is our current annual contribution - when it does not have broad public approval ?
